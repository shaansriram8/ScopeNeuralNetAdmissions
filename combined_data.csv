During high school, I realized my passion for economics revealing the potential that lies in consultingâ€”a path that harmoniously blends my passion for both CS and Economics. My ambition is to bring about a revolutionary change by crafting solutions that are not only technically sound but also economically viable.
 
 I aspire to join SCOPE Consulting as it offers a platform to delve into the consulting field, enrich my understanding of business and economics, and further hone my technological skill set. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to collaborate with fellow members, exchanging knowledge and collectively expanding our expertise.","My coding journey commenced at the age of 11 and has since grown into a profound passion, leading me through a diverse array of experiences that have enriched my skill set. As a result, I offer a substantial collection of skills, expertise, and knowledge that would greatly benefit SCOPE Consulting and its team.
 In the realm of technical proficiency, I have amassed a wealth of experience through engagement in numerous hackathons, the creation of personal projects, and my involvement in professional app development. My expertise extends to crafting web apps using NodeJS and ExpressJS, as well as creating cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter. In addition, my mastery of Python, honed over a span of 4+ years, equips me to tackle a wide spectrum of challenges. 
 
 My achievements and leadership roles have further refined my abilities. As a national finalist at the esteemed Toyota Hackathon held at IIT-Delhi, I have demonstrated my aptitude for thriving in competitive technical environments. My role as President of the school's tech club exemplified my leadership capabilities, guiding the team to secure more than 150 awards and 6 overall trophies in more than 15 events. I was also the lead student organizer of Robotronics, an inter-school tech symposium that saw over 500 participants from 30+ schools. I was responsible for coordination among all stakeholders, communication between the host school and participants, and ensuring an overall smooth functioning of the event. A passion for sustainability has guided my endeavors as well. Through a data analytics project focused on electricity consumption at my school, I conducted a comprehensive analysis spanning consumption from both fossil fuels and renewable sources. The project further encompassed an assessment of the impact of solar panels, energy-saving initiatives, and LED installations. This initiative garnered recognition through a certificate of merit bestowed by the Honourable President of India, Smt Droupadi Murmu.
 
 My affinity for debating culminated in my achievement as a national semifinalist at Mahabehes '21, the largest student debating championship in India. This proficiency, coupled with my fervent interest in economics and business, propels my aspiration to seamlessly integrate these facets with the world of consulting.
 Collectively, my technical acumen, leadership prowess, commitment to sustainability, and diverse passions align harmoniously with the values and aspirations of SCOPE Consulting. The prospect of contributing these attributes to the team excites me, promising a mutually enriching collaboration that yields impactful results.","I'm eager to acquire insights into the world of consulting and further develop my expertise in technology and economics.

SCOPE provides real-world consulting experience which I will use to develop my consulting expertise and my understanding of the industries I work with. SCOPE provides the unique experience of directly working with clientele. In my previous consulting positions, I reported solely to my project leads, with little interaction with client representatives. I hope to gain experience in initiating and developing projects with the clients themselves. Furthermore, I will collaborate with like-minded people from diverse backgrounds who genuinely enjoy developing solutions while bringing unique perspectives to the team. I consider this a strength because it enables me to become more flexible, understanding, and adaptive to both my team at SCOPE and the clients we serve. However, I understand that I must bring my full effort and workmanship to the SCOPE team. Above all else, I want to leave SCOPE better off than when I joined. ","I have previous experience in a boutique business management consulting firm, wherein I Reviewed and validated the discrepancies in over 150 contracts between an acquired FBO network and partnered airlines during an acquisition; composed and presented findings and recommendations to solve the contract discrepancies to a lead director of the acquiring FBO network; integrated over 500 vendor identities and expenditures between two leading flight support companies; developed real time models to determine cost-effective aviation fuel suppliers for fixed-base operators; and organized a country-wide promotional air tour. 

Furthermore, I am currently participating in a variety of research positions. I am working with New York University to determine the relation between kidney quality and transplant turnover rate. I am also collaborating with a professor at Purdue University to develop methodologies which predict consumer preferences based on the decisions they make and the products available to them.

Lastly, I am collaborating with a leading cybersecurity firm to combine both qualitative and quantitative risk factors. 

My experience in model development, particularly in predictive analytics boosts SCOPE's ability to apply evidence-based data to optimize and improve client operations, especially in route management and market analysis. 

Likewise, I can use my past expertise in mergers and acquisitions, specifically regarding contract management and vendor integration to help SCOPE take on new project opportunities in business management.","I wish to gain three key abilities by joining the SCOPE Consulting team. 

First, I desire to grow as a team member and as consultant. SCOPE will enable me to collaborate with a wide variety of consultants with unique perspectives and individual worldviews. My exposure and participation with the SCOPE team will encourage me to constantly adapt, think both critically and on my feet, and to adopt new ways of thinking on how to approach both projects and people. 

Second, I wish to put my methodological research into practice. I will be able to apply my applications to projects at SCOPE, which gives me the excellent opportunity to further refine and develop my research in the consumer analytics and operations fields. 

Last, I hope to refine my presentational and conversational abilities when addressing clients and team members. I will cherish the time I wish to spend at SCOPE communicating with project leads and clients, because I will gain a higher understanding of ways to concisely convey detail-oriented information.",Email,,

My team was conformed from people of all different backgrounds and mindsets. This project lasted 2 months in the making and it had many stages where we had to work together and settle down agreements. Additionally, during the job I had over the summer as a production intern managing a project on how to reduce wooden pallets for packaging services, this was more of an investigative project where I had to talk to a variety of people from different areas and every time I spoke to a worker, a challenge appears. And every time I thought I had it all figured out, it turns I had not.

 Secondly, the applications of software in even the most unimaginable of places is super exciting, admirable, and inspiring to say the least. Being a CS major, I am always interested in finding ways to incorporate software development/data analyses into whatever situation it may yield effective. On the flip side, I also have experience in product development and marketing, and am looking for ways to apply that knowledge in projects and learn more from my peers about these areas.
 
 Additionally, I enjoy working on different problem spaces, alongside taking ideas and concepts from one space and applying them in another. When pursuing internships or personal projects, I am always looking to broaden my knowledge base and experience different business functions and problems. With this opportunity at Scope, I would be able to do just that, while also enriching upon my prior industry experience and building bonds with like-minded individuals to constitute a valuable experience through SCOPE.","To SCOPE and my team, I can bring both technical and nontechnical knowledge.

  -Vice President of Chapter Events and Treasurer at Purdue FBLA","The field of consulting resonates well with my personality and work style. There are various lessons I would love to pull from SCOPE to enhance and improve my personal development. One of the main pillars of SCOPE is the concept of community service, and I would love to have the satisfaction of serving business needs while contributing to the community. I find happiness in seeing how my ideas and possible solutions can help a small company go from good to great rather than seeing a giant company grow to become more powerful. 
 
  SCOPE also serves as a place to sharpen my problem-solving skills. This is an important life skill to have both in the workforce but also in my personal life. SCOPE will enable me to develop this skill by allowing me to work on various projects and work around issues that will require critical thinking skills to be used. Furthermore, while the classes I take at Purdue are very informative and great, SCOPE will give me the accurate and necessary real-life issues to learn how to apply them to the areas of Technology, Finance, and Data, something which is very important in the day and age we live in now. These skills I will learn at SCOPE will help prepare me for the future in whatever task, job, or position I hold.
 
  Last but not least, SCOPE is home to a multitude of unique majors and people. With many different people from various backgrounds, I am excited to Network with a group of peers for future opportunities and personal growth.

Management consulting and general consulting are great options and SCOPE consulting gives me a special opportunity to simulate how these occupations will be. In addition to this, if I do decide that I want to pursue consulting, SCOPE has case competitions, JE Summit, a strong network for me to learn from. SCOPE will allow me to work on projects that I can speak passionately about in interviews, and there is evidence that SCOPE places well. As a freshman, the experience I will build from SCOPE will put me on the career trajectory that I want.","I have a history of working with clients. I acquired my own clients by using Nextdoor, Whatsapp, and Facebook for both private basketball coaching and private math tutoring. In addition to this, I negotiated prices with parents to ensure a healthy client relationship. Whether it’s a basketball team, a fintech club, or an entrepreneurship competition, I have plenty of experience working in teams. SCOPE is full of the most talented Purdue students, and I have been in a similar situation before. I attended and graduated from the #1 public high school in America.

Research: 4-6 hours","A big reason why SCOPE consulting is an intriguing junior enterprise to apply to is the real life decision making aspect of it and the thought process behind it. Every company has difficult decisions that they have to make with the goal of creating profit. I am interested in learning the process on how to make the best possible decision while also providing valuable input. One fact that excites me is the fact that SCOPE works with companies and uses real life scenarios in their cases and projects. I am excited to see how decisions are accessed and ultimately how a final verdict is reached. Another aspect which interests me is networking, within and outside of SCOPE. In SCOPE, members come from all over the world and are in multiple different majors. I would be thrilled to get to know more about how others go about solving problems by working with them and how their experiences and expertise help us reach a solution. Outside of SCOPE, in a professional setting, exploring jobs and meeting people in them will be helpful in exploring different career paths and understanding what it takes to be a professional.","As an engineering student, throughout my first year of school, we worked in teams in most of my classes such as engineering, physics, and computer science. I used good teamwork skills such as doing my part, making sure everyone knew what was going on, and giving and receiving feedback. I believe that everyone's voice is important and that everyone’s ideas should be taken into consideration. This ensures that we have multiple different and unique perspectives on a situation which is important in consulting. In my early years of high school, I participated in a club similar to SCOPE called LaunchX which was a entrepreneurship club. My team’s idea was to create an app that tracks school bus locations so that children don't have to stand in the cold or rain while waiting for their bus. We gave multiple presentations to other teams and even designed an app. While working with my SCOPE team I can apply what I learned in LaunchX to provide prior experience and further help out my team. ","No matter what major you're in, having valuable professional skills can go a long way. Skills such as communication, problem solving, creativity, and being a good leader are extremely important as we move further into college and professional life. I hope to strengthen these skills through tackling real world scenarios in various disciplines such as engineering, computer science, and business. Through multiple cases and projects, I hope to gain valuable knowledge of how to deal with real life scenarios and improve my efficiency in the way to go about solving them. Additionally, working with local companies creates a professional workplace environment where we can tackle and analyze problems and help come up with solutions. This environment will be a job like experience where I will better understand how companies work. ","Purdue Website, Lohit Bhatnagar",,

I also appreciate the semester-long project format, as it inherently fosters an environment allowing for the team to achieve optimal project outcomes.

I am currently in the process of planning a case competition and gaining members for the club, which shows my capacity to organize effective events. Also, I believe I collaborate well with others in an efficient fashion. An example of this is seen from me when creating ties with university sales engineering organizations across the nation. As a Digital Health intern at Aster DM Healthcare, my skills in analysis and problem-solving have been sharpened. By utilizing semrush, I collected data on conversion rates of several ecommerece mobile apps across the MENA region, which eventually culminated into a presentation of a competitive analysis that I gave to fifteen senior members of the digital health team.

My past experience both in technical and business side of things in a consulting and a startup respectively will allow to not only structure the business problem but hustle through to design the required solution with my team members while simultaneously engaging with clients, which can help foster a lasting relationship.

Secondly, I believe every country has some specific ways of conducting businesses as well as forms of engagement. In that perspective, Scope also provides a wonderful platform to interact and connect with global student fraternity and in a way learn the intricacies of management in a completely new country.

While working in analytics consulting I supported my client in utility industry in data driven insights with help of tools like SAS, SQL and Python. I used Hadoop database using HIVE interface to extract and analyze consumption level data and explored Experian database to analyze customer behavior.

On business side, I have extensive experience in business planning for a hospitability tech company where I was actively involved in financial forecasting, cost optimization, development of annual operating plan, management reporting and benchmarking. 
I also tend to believe that I have strong quantitative and logical capabilities. As a people person, I can get along with my team quite easily and create a coherent atmosphere within the club so as to deliver value effectively.

Firstly, I am extremely interested in business, and I am considering a minor in finance in the near future. With business, and specifically business optimization, being a love of mine, I am excited about the fact that I can combine my major and my passions in such an easy way. When I found this club at the Purdue Club Fair, the club was well-explained and seemed extremely inviting. I felt like I could make an impact on that club, especially in the data analytics field. Data is extremely important and needs to analyzed when working with businesses and consulting. The work I am doing with the Data Mine as well as what I learn in my classes can be put to great use with SCOPE Consulting. More importantly, I want to work with like-minded individuals who can see the business and data side when coming up with real-world solutions, so this club attracts me a lot.","My mentality, personality, and skillset allow me to bring much to SCOPE Consulting. Firstly, I have been immersed in data for years. I have worked on high-scale projects with universities, such as Kean University, that were tested on software worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. My role in these projects included me being able to analyze data and put it to good use, in order to prevent automobile accidents in the future. In addition to this project, I analyzed extremely large datasets of words in order to analyze if AI on Twitter could interpret the sentiment of tweets, and to find business solutions to such issues so that firms/individuals would not be affected by incorrect sentiment analysis. Overall, I have spent many years of the latter half of my life working with data analytics, and have also dug deep into business solutions and optimization, and my project experience has set me up to do well with SCOPE Consulting.","Since this is my first year at Purdue, this experience will truly set me up for the working world. I am not too sure where I will end up in life, but I see myself working in a similar field regarding business and data, rather than strictly computers and software. This club is in particular important for me because it combines both my passions. Additionally, working with the upperclassmen and other firms will be significant, as I can take many tips from them. Specifically, I am excited to meet other consultants and learn from them. I also like how this club is very work-oriented, being almost like a 9-5 but not as long. It will truly prepare me for all the internships and jobs I can get during and after college. Also, I think that SCOPE will teach me how to maximize usage of data in an effective manner.

 1. Business 
 I am experienced in marketing, social media, and operations through my involvement in various non-profit projects/ventures. I have worked two internships in digital marketing and social media outreach to increase engagement and then also expand audience by catering content to a specific demographic. I have operations experience from multiple ventures. One of my favourites being organising a ration drive to provide covid relief for waste pickers. I coordinated the partnership with the NGO, managed the entire drive ( locations + logistics) as well managing the volunteer team. I was also a TEDxPurdueU logistics committee member last year.
 Although it is completely unrelated to my major, it is weirdly a niche I enjoy, and I am constantly watching educational content on marketing as a hobby. These roles are fairly intuitive for me. 
 2. Engineering
 It is directly related to my major and is one I am constantly growing in. 
 3. Data Analytics 
 Almost all my classes this semester involve statistics and data. One of my classes is ' data visualisation and inference'. I will also be working with data analytics and image processing in my VIP research team this semester which focuses on IoT sensors in manufacturing.

I am fairly skilled at Matlab as well if needed to interpret data.","I am exploring consulting as an industry and I guess I want to understand it better through the various professional and networking opportunities/events provided such as case competitions, workshops etc. I also want to grow my skillset because the more I read about the work involved and skills required, the more it seems like a match for me as an IE+Econ student. Having always been interested in business and engineering, I am excited to apply engineering skills in business projects and vice-versa. I really want to push myself to learn and be involved in unconventional projects that are exploring new pathways such as artificial intelligence and building tools the way the Anu team did. I want to grow to be a leader in the organisation which is really important to me because I see myself being a leader in my job. Lastly, I can tell the students in this organisation are extremely talented and will offer me diverse knowledge.

No, I'm not referring to them being consultants. While that's probably true, what I am actually referring to are analytical people. People that can make the most optimal decision given a dataset. People that can piece together a strategy in their head as they converse with their clients. It's not being a consultant that makes them special, although consulting is a profession that requires you to have these traits. Being someone who values helping others alongside being a data-driven person, joining Scope only seems natural.

Relative to the other consulting clubs at Purdue, SCOPE is far more diverse. With diversity comes a myriad of different perspectives and points of view that enhance productivity, efficiency, and quality of work compared to narrow-minded approaches. Additionally, I’m enticed by SCOPE’s diversity of clientele. SCOPE’s past clients, for example, Boiler Vintage, Indie Coffee Roasters, and Cordian Technologies, represent a vast array of industries namely, food/beverage, clothing, and even the intersection of the technology and medical sectors. Finally, SCOPE’s focus on local businesses as well as its commitment to serving non-profit organizations such as Shine On University and LTHC excite me because I will be able to serve my community and witness firsthand the tangible impact of my work. I had the great opportunity of speaking to Haley and other members of the club who shared personal stories attesting to SCOPE’s camaraderie and positive work environment. These anecdotes tell the story of a SCOPE experience that doesn’t segregate work from fun, and that’s a community I want to be part of. ","In high school, I volunteered at Advocate Sherman Hospital. I was heavily involved in the day-to-day operations and often worked as an assistant for administrative staff in addition to my assigned duties. Following around a senior manager for weeks provided me with a firsthand account of all the components required to keep one of the most premier regional hospitals in the country a well-oiled machine. The insights I gained working at Advocate Sherman can translate to SCOPE because, despite the ethical issues, hospitals do follow a for-profit model. The ingredients of Advocate Sherman’s successful business model are the missing pieces for which clients seek consulting services. Some of these pieces include operations and staff management, regulatory and compliance knowledge, quality assurance, marketing, and even simple cost-benefit analysis that goes into day-to-day decision-making. Watching and helping administrators execute these skills on a large scale leaves me confident that I will be able to bring expertise regarding the essential components of a successful business and use this knowledge to help clients achieve their goals. My experience at Advocate Sherman has provided me with the foundational business acumen that I am eager to expand upon through professional development through SCOPE. ","I hope to grow both personally and professionally from this experience. Regarding my professional aspirations, I hope to better prepare myself for real-world opportunities after I graduate. In other words, I’m seeking professional development, whether that be through acquiring skills such as thorough market research and social media strategy, learning the art of slide design and presentation, or even how to conduct myself appropriately in business settings and display professionalism. In addition to this professional development, I hope to develop casing and networking skills strong enough to land myself an internship in the coming summers. My personal goal is to join a collaborative community of ambitious individuals with similar interests. I hope to make friends with other members, not just within the confines of club meetings or events, but friends to go to football games with, enjoy a cup of coffee with, and maybe someday even live with. Having similar interests will allow us to help each other grow personally and professionally, potentially developing friendships that don’t expire when we are handed our diplomas. Finally, I hope to contribute back to the club, helping it grow in the coming years by putting forth my full effort into recruiting new talent and advising underclassmen members once I become an upperclassman. I aspire to be a part of the board and expand the club’s presence on campus in the coming years, ultimately building a strong, active alumni network by the time I graduate.","Instagram, Purdue Website, B-involved fair ",,

Badminton club: 2-3 hours/week","Out of SCOPE Consulting’s services, their projects in Data Analytics stood out to me and differentiated SCOPE amongst Purdue’s ocean of clubs. 

The project for TrueBlood Real Estate, Purdue University’s official Real Estate Brokerage, appealed to my strong sense of community with the idea of assisting local companies using my skillset. 

And the project for Cordian Technologies displayed the strong overlap between consulting and my major, computer science. I have always been fascinated with the amalgamation of the two, especially in recent years, and I hope to join SCOPE in order to continue breaking the boundaries between the two. 

SCOPE initially caught my attention at the B-Involved fair, especially after I was informed that two of their upcoming projects for next year were computer science projects. But as I researched more, I became more intrigued with SCOPE’s goal of equipping students with consulting and world experience with real companies, a unique opportunity and a mission that I would love to contribute to.","During my time programming, I have created several projects before, and my creative side shines in how I choose to solve problems and obstacles I encounter while coding, such as enhancing a basic algorithm called “Drunkard’s Walk” to better fit the project I was working on. 

But without a doubt, the most important experience I will bring is my teamwork experience and capability to lead. In my state’s Lieutenant Governor’s Programming App Challenge, I worked alongside a team through every stage, creating roles and responsibilities in order to complete our project while still making sure to have fun

I also have extensive tutoring experience, which I believe could be of use as I planned lessons and accounted for my students' needs during each lesson, something that could translate over to consulting and considerations of companies' needs.","I am not only eager to enter the world of consulting, but also to gain a lot of experience in working alongside a team of driven individuals. 

I hope that by contributing my creativity and programming skills, I will be able to meet and bond with a team as we tackle a company’s challenges together.

Those clubs will most likely have a low time commitment of one hour or so. ","I found out about SCOPE Consulting at the Be-Involved Fair, during which I walked through every single table and looked at what was probably at least 100 organizations. In a sea of opportunities, SCOPE Consulting stood out to me for several reasons. 
There were several clubs I saw that involved completing various projects, but didn’t include the opportunity to work with actual companies. I love the opportunity in SCOPE Consulting to create relations with companies in West Lafayette and help the local community thrive. 
In addition, I loved a lot of subjects in high school and really struggled to choose the one thing I liked. I’m not sure what I have in mind for a career, but I know I want it to involve several different types of fields. SCOPE Consulting will give me the opportunity to dive deeper into the intersections between disciplines and explore consulting as a career. 
I’m also interested in the Marketing Committee. In high school, I created and designed Instagram posts for my school’s music honors society and I’d like to continue social media outreach. 
Finally, I eventually want to pursue a minor in business or a business related field.","     In high school, I participated in the DECA (or Distributive Education Clubs of America) business competition. The competition I primarily competed in was Integrated Marketing Campaign. In this competition, I worked with fellow team members to plan and present a marketing campaign for a local business. In senior year, my group and I placed 3rd at the state competition, earning us a spot at the International Competition. I also earned 5th place in the test portion of my event. 
     That year, my marketing campaign was about a local Bubble Tea business. To create a plan that would increase the social media presence of the company, I researched the surrounding area and market of my city and took notes of everything, including population size, surrounding competitors, and even the company’s most popular Instagram posts in the past two years. I also worked on writing the speech for my presentation and practiced my poise and confidence.
While looking at the “Spring 2023 Semester Yearbook” on Scope’s website, I found that many of the projects involved keeping track of large amounts of data. This is something that I keep in practice in my daily life. In my senior year, I was responsible for setting up tutoring sign-up spreadsheets for a 100+ person Honors Society at my school. I would even send reminder emails to students to remind them to show up for their tutoring time. 
In addition, I did a second DECA event last year which involved managing a virtual hotel simulation. Each simulation took an average of six hours to complete, as I carefully wrote down the trends that the hotel took on as my team members and I adjusted employee prices, room rates, and even advertising. The process paid off though, as my group and I placed in the top 16% of teams nationally, as well as first in the state. 

     Developing my presentation, data analysis, and business skills over the years has led to some truly incredible experiences. From going to the DECA International Competition and getting to meet others who were interested in business to seeing the appreciation from the school that I helped organize tutoring for, the work that I did to prepare for these things is something I would never take back. And I am excited to use my skills to help companies succeed in SCOPE. ","I became a Computer Science major because I fell in love with solving coding problems. My AP Computer Science A class was one of my favorite times of the day. No matter what was going on, I could sit there and use 110% of myself to work through coding problems that I didn’t understand. The feeling of success after I had worked through one problem for the entire 48 minutes of class made the journey to get there even more incredible. 
	However, one negative stereotype about CS majors is that they sit there in silence, doing problem sets holed up in their rooms. But I think pursuing outside outreach and collaboration opportunities is especially important in a tech industry, and I hope to use the experience and resources gained through SCOPE to get lifelong connections and career experience. 
I’ve always sought out ways to improve my presentation and communication skills. From presenting my research in my AP Research class to becoming the Vice President of my school’s Math Honors Society and addressing the room during meetings, I’ve fallen in love with improving this skill. 
In addition, I look forward to networking with other companies and professionals during some of SCOPE’s events, such as the Consulting Career Fair. 
Finally, I am interested in seeing the intersection of CS and business up-close in a more real-world format and to see the possibilities that are available if/when I decided to pursue a minor in business. ",B-Involved Fair,Thank you so much for taking the time to review my application. ,

I believe teamwork to be one of the greatest strengths a group can have, and my experience leading teams through club leadership or project-based environments have taught me a lot about it. One thing to note about me, however, is that soft skills are not the only things I believe I can offer to SCOPE Consulting. As an engineer and aspiring math double major, my quantitative skills are up to par as well. With consulting combining these two aspects, I know my years of exposure to the composition that goes into supporting a successful business/team will be of aid to my teammates at SCOPE Consulting. To summarize, I wish to bring my teamwork, communication, and quantitative/reasoning skills to help clients at SCOPE.","By joining SCOPE Consulting, I hope to delve into the world of professional consulting and learn how to better provide business solutions while also helping clients. By increasing my knowledge in this area, I know it will benefit both my professional and personal life. Most of all, however, I look forward to creating lifelong connections with all the members at SCOPE.","Linkedin, Instagram",I look forward to meeting you all!,I have not applied to Scope before.

Having since learned more about SCOPE and consulting as a whole, I am now hoping to make the jump to becoming a consultant, and am particularly interested in the Operations and Supply Chain work SCOPE does. Supply Chain work has been the most interesting field within Industrial Engineering for me ever since I learned about the major, and I aspire to start a Supply Chain Consulting or Logistics Management firm later in my career. Getting involved in SCOPE is a great way for me to learn more about how consulting works and to build my skills in the services SCOPE provides their clients.","I come to SCOPE with significant leadership and project management experiences as the president of my high school robotics club and vice president of learning communities in my fraternity. I believe these traits along with an engineering problem-solving mindset makes me a strong consultant because it allows me to communicate fluidly with customers and team members and understand any technical aspects of a project. Additionally, I am highly interested in a number of the fields SCOPE works in, so my skills could be used on a variety of projects. Despite being a first year engineer, I have experience with Industrial Engineering coursework and problem sets, as I took a IE overview course the summer after my junior year through the University of Tennessee Knoxville.","Participating in SCOPE will give me opportunities to practice consulting before I venture into the professional world, both to ensure that I am interested in the field and to gain the skills I will need to be successful in it. The professional development resources SCOPE provides will also help me secure a job in consulting.

I first learned about consulting when I spoke to a cousin of mine who worked at Deloitte for several years after graduating college. Her team was contracted by the government, and she worked on important projects that helped the government make decisions. She told me that I should consider consulting, as it is not only interesting, but fun and rewarding as well.
After a few semesters studying engineering, I feel as though consulting may be more geared towards my interests. I know that many engineering graduates end up in consulting jobs, so when I received the invitation to the Scope callout, I figured that this would be the perfect opportunity to see what consulting is all about. Working with peers in a student-led organization seems like the perfect environment to begin consulting, one in which I have much of the same responsibility as I would as a paid consultant, but without the pressures of corporate life.","As someone who is biracial, I am comfortable working in a diverse environment because of my exposure to different cultures and countries.

SCOPE is a unique consulting firm, in which it provides services in business, engineering, and data analytics. Being a mechanical engineering major, engineering consulting intrigues me as I am keen to provide clients technical solutions, optimize their products, and develop prototypes. However, being interdisciplinary is key in the modern workforce. I look forward to expanding my knowledge in data analytics and business during my college career as well. Likewise, I am excited by the potential opportunity of being face to face with different clients. I enjoy the potential challenge of communicating with them to develop solutions to help their business. ","As an undergraduate researcher, I possess a lot of the qualities a consultant would. At the start of my research, I conducted a thorough literature review to understand my field of research (additive manufacturing of energetic materials) which is very similar to the problem scoping process in consulting. I have read through over 20 papers involving my field of research and was able to synthesize the information in a cohesive literature review in the introduction in my research paper during the Fall semester.  Furthermore, I have weekly meetings with my research advisor to present my findings in my experiments as well as defend my conclusions. This process is very similar to having weekly meetings with a client and presenting solutions to them. During my research, I learned how to be coherent in my findings while finding the appropriate tone to effectively communicate my ideas. 

Likewise, I have worked on several engineering projects throughout my time at Purdue. These projects have given me lots of experience in product design, CAD modeling, and prototyping my final idea. During my sophomore capstone project, my group conducted an economic analysis on our product which presented the break-even point, the return on investment, and our profit margins. 

On top of my current engineering skills, I am actively pursuing more technical skills. I’ve participated in the Purdue Milestones in which I took the Intro to Programming an Arduino course and am currently taking courses in PCB design and Fusion 360. Furthermore, I’m nearing completion in my certificate in Python for Data Science. 

Moreover, I have worked in Chick-fil-a as a front of house team member. Therefore, I am well acquainted with the day-to-day operation of one of the best fast-food chains in the world. The day-to-day operation of a fast-food restaurant has commonalities with retail stores and sit-down restaurants which consists of a bulk of SCOPE’s clients. 

Therefore, I will bring a wealth of technical abilities to SCOPE consulting along with emotional intelligence of presenting solutions to clients in a clear and cohesive manner. Along with my current skills I will show the willingness to learn from the project lead and from my team members in order for us to collaborate and present the best solution to our client. ","From this experience, I hope to gain a lot of interactions with different clients. Understanding a client’s need is crucial to any problem-solving process. Interacting with clients on a weekly basis will refine my emotional intelligence and communication skills as I speak with clients in my future job. Furthermore, I would like to have consulting experience on my resume as I aspire to apply for consulting positions in the future. Moreover, a personal goal of mine would be to open my own engineering consulting firm in which I assist engineering companies with their product design, and manufacturing process optimization.

If you set me up with a client, a new business group, I can make conversation and feel extremely comfortable doing it. I genuinely love working with people, and I know that will come in handy when working with our clients, teammates, and more. At my job at the Women in Engineering Office, I find my favorite days are when we hold events for high schoolers. In the fall, we held an event where high school juniors and seniors, they learned about Purdue Engineering. My job was to chat with students, make them feel more comfortable, etc. I loved doing this, and a parent even mentioned me in a survey response later thanking me for how I was able to make her daughter more at ease with admissions decisions. I am a people person, through and through, which will be a strong asset for SCOPE consulting. I also enjoy learning new things, whether that be learning to make clothes because I was bored over break or learning how to CAD because no one else on my team knew how to. I like learning new things and I like acquiring new skills. I’m willing to put the work in because I want to be better, and I want SCOPE to be better. And last, I’m passionate! I once did a business pitch competition at Purdue, and I pitched a feminine products subscription box for teenage girls. I loved this experience because I was able to think critically, and I loved reaching out to people asking for their input and thoughts on our idea. My team and I worked hard to make our product idea sound, and we won the pitch competition! I’m passionate about consulting, because I love the idea of being able to help a business improve. I will bring that passion to SCOPE and will work hard to accomplish all goals. ","I hope to develop my ability to problem solve and find a new community. Problem solving is not only an important part of engineering, but an important part of life, and I want to continuously improve that skill.

Personally, I haven't been exposed to a consultation group before, however, the reason and motto the club stands for got me interested in SCOPE Consulting. In addition, to what the club stands for, I was very interested in the different aspects of the club and how it combined business, engineering, and data analytics. I am currently a Computer Engineering major, however, I am very passionate about data science and analytics, so this club would be a great fit for me to integrate both of them and learn them for my future. I also like how this club is focused on helping small businesses with real-life problems and that will help me gain experience on how to handle problems in the workplace and give me a headstart in that area. All things considered, I am very interested in joining SCOPE Consulting due to these reasons. ","I will bring knowledge about data analytics as that is part of my passion and something I am very interested in. I know a lot about and am passionate about how to gather data as well as turn them into important values/information. Some skills I will bring are communication and organization as these two are very important when working in a team setting. I have previously been part of team/individual sports in swimming, cross country, and track and in all these two sports the two skills I mentioned are very important. So, I will bring these two skills in order to first be organized with the plan of what to do in the projects as well as in data collection and communication-wise, it is important to communicate in a team setting to keep on track, produce successful results, and meet deadlines.","I hope to gain new insights into the consulting world, mainly the data analytics part.

I have always gotten excited when faced with a challenging programming problem. I find the process of brainstorming, designing, testing, and redesigning both challenging and fulfilling. I have also always been interested in the business aspect of technology companies, and I plan on minoring in economics.  Scope consulting is the perfect opportunity to combine my passion for software engineering with real world business applications. I hope to join a project where I can use and developed my programming skillset to deliver a useful solution to a business. I am enticed by the possible opportunities to work with a team of diverse but likeminded individuals who are highly motivated, dedicated, and passionate about the work they produce. By surrounding myself with individuals who share similar values to my own, I hope to join a community that will challenge me while also allowing me to form new connections and friendships. ","Through my high school and early college career, I have collaborated on many projects that have provided me with invaluable experiences. I hope to bring some of the knowledge, skills, and expertise I gained from these projects to SCOPE. Currently, I am working on an EPICS engineering team to deliver an electrical pole storage solution for our community partner Habitats for Humanity. Working on this team, I have learned a lot about working with a partner to design a solution from scratch. Throughout last semester, I communicated with our partner to build specifications based off user needs, develop a project timeline, and work through the engineering process. Within my team of peers, I coordinated meeting times, created meeting agendas, documented team progress, and contributed to the research and brainstorming process. Additionally, I have some mild experience with social media marketing and sales strategies. In my senior year of high school, I worked at a local restaurant. The business was suffering from a lack of new customers. I helped the owner design a strategy to bring in more customers by establishing a social media presence and advertising special weekly deals. I also have some technical skills that may be useful to a SCOPE project. I have decent experience coding in the languages Python, Java, and MATLAB. I am currently self-teaching myself higher level Python concepts through personal projects using API data and basic Graphical User Interface technology. I also am a very comfortable public speaker. I have designed and presented seminars on basic leadership concepts to groups of around 70-100 peers on multiple occasions. I hope to bring these skillsets to a SCOPE team and help my peers learn and benefit from the experiences I’ve had, just as I hope to learn and grow from my fellow peers’ experiences. ","By joining SCOPE, I hope to learn more of the business aspect of consulting, while developing my technical skills through one of the clubs’ projects. I am motivated by the idea that each project places a lot of accountabilities on the team members, so there is a clear standard that each member must put their absolute best work out. I hope to work with and learn from experienced individuals in and outside of the club. Additionally, I would love to get to know each member personally, form friendships and ask and learn about their other experiences at Purdue outside of the club. I also want to further develop the soft skills to connect and network with consulting partners and form meaningful business relationships with clients.

It allows for collaboration across many different majors and, in my opinion, results in more cohesive solutions, ones that I might not have thought of by myself or with a team of only other mechanical engineers. The most exciting part of consulting for me is the evaluation of the various strategies a company can pursue and providing well-thought-out recommendations for those companies. It’s interesting to research and substantiate the solutions that can solve a problem. Before I make decisions in my own life, I consider my options and the likely outcomes; I see consulting as a reflection of my own personality. I also like how consulting allows one to work with different companies on a variety of problems, giving consultants the opportunity to keep their jobs fresh.","My ability to collaborate while still being a leader is the best trait I can bring to SCOPE consulting. It allows me to work with others, gather our collective insights, and, ultimately, bring the best ideas together into a cohesive plan. I find this to be extremely important in any team setting but especially in consulting. Also, I have experience in consulting scenarios. In high school, I participated in DECA, a business roleplay club, and placed first in the state of Illinois in my sector. In this club, I would be presented with a financial or marketing problem a theoretical company was having and would recommend a solution in a ten-minute presentation to a judge. The experience I have from DECA directly correlates to what SCOPE consulting does.

I bring unique skills that come with being a biomedical engineer. I have the ability to use intricate knowledge to make an informed decision while prioritizing the patients (clients) and their best interests above all. It is key to keep a level head and use solid analysis skills with minimal error. My business economics minor provides me with a different set of skills including being able to evaluate a population and predict consumer behavior.

1/22/2023 23:28:35,,,Junior,December 2024,Mechanical Engineering,Business Economics,,Yes,No,Yes,Pi Tau Sigma - 4 Hours per week,"I have always been interested in getting involved with consulting. Consultants provide expert advice and guidance to organizations to improve best practices and solve issues. Without consultants, organizations are unable to get a fresh set of eyes to derive solutions based on data. As an engineer, I believe consulting is one of the best ways I can use the skills I've learned in class for practical application in the business world.

As a student already involved in the COOP program with a semester of industry experience already under my belt, I have seen firsthand the importance of problem-solving in industry. This further reinforced my interest in consulting.

I chose to join SCOPE over other consulting organizations on campus because of their emphasis on personal and professional development. Through participation in case competitions and working in small, 3-6 person project teams, I see plenty of room to grow and learn from others while having a positive impact on the community. Additionally, the organization's ability to take a project from start to finish in one semester speaks to their efficiency and the hardworking nature of their members.","I have extensive industry experience under my belt. I gained firsthand experience of the common issues operators and employees face in the industry by working on the factory line in manufacturing the summer before school. Last semester, I completed a full co-op rotation with Avient, a global material formulation company. As a site process engineer at one of their manufacturing facilities, I was tasked with addressing issues around the site, either by conversing with operators or management or by observing them myself. I was also responsible for independently developing solutions to these issues and presenting them in a large presentation at the end of my rotation. During my rotation, I took on five major projects that had over $60,000 in value. Although it was challenging to juggle five major projects at once, with the help of my mentors, I was able to develop data-backed solutions for all of them, which were slated to lead to massive risk reduction in employee plant practices. I believe my firsthand experience in industry and industrial project work will be invaluable to SCOPE.
In addition, I have baseline consulting experience, as I worked an internship at a veteran-owned aerospace consulting firm called Patriot Industrial Partners. There, I forged connections with middle-market aerospace companies, a skill that I believe would be highly beneficial to SCOPE.","I hope to gain experience in the field of consulting, and further develop skill that will help me succeed in the business world.",Purdue Website,"I am slated to graduated in December 2024 due to my participation in the coop program. However, all other co-op rotations will be in the summer time, and will not interfere with my ability to be in SCOPE.

The biggest reason is that most jobs value depth of knowledge, or specialization, significantly more than breadth and hence, almost no jobs expose people to a variety of new topics and skills quite like consulting does due its fast-paced nature. The opportunity to be consistently intellectually stimulated is something I value in projects that I take up. Secondly, and more importantly, I want to join an organization that does not just take up interesting and engaging projects, but also provides me with an outlet to make a tangible impact on campus and community through collaborative teamwork. I think SCOPE Consulting is the perfect place for me since your organization values engagement and commitment more that anything. I strongly believe that these qualities are indispensable for an aspiring consultant. This is because, while an existing skillset is important, it cannot be fully utilized without genuine engagement with clients, as well as commitment to bettering oneself at solving industry problems through learning from peers and past mistakes. ","Firstly, it is my fair assumption that not many people applying to SCOPE are in their senior year like me. I believe that me being further along in my coursework, especially as a double major, provides me with the knowledge that possibly not many other lowerclassmen would possess. Being a senior also means that I have had more time to gain professional experience and develop a strong skillset. For example, I have interned for two summers and gained valuable interpersonal skills through working with clients and colleagues. One of my internships was at Tesla in Summer 2022 as a manufacturing engineer. I was instantly thrown into a challenging and fast-paced environment and had to adapt to a steep learning curve. Over my time there, I had the chance to collaborate with my team on solving various Cybertruck design challenges while simultaneously taking up independent projects to aid higher level decision making. One of my primary responsibilities at Tesla was line balancing over a thousand processes for the Cybertruck and I can definitely say that I have become extremely proficient at using powerful analytical tools such as Excel, R and Python due to using them extensively for meeting design constraints while balancing based on time and station count constraints. I also took initiative and carried out multiple time and comparison studies, the findings of which were even presented in executive level meetings to drive better decision making. While most of my work experience is in technical roles and industries, the skills I have gained are easily transferable to a variety of consulting problems. In addition to my work experience, I have also been a part of various clubs like TedXPurdueU wherein I have built strong interpersonal relationships with speakers and efficiently handled the logistics of large events. Lastly, and most importantly, I have taken part in various case competitions, one of which was the Deloitte National Undergraduate case competition. My team secured first place in the competition with other Purdue teams and went on to represent Purdue on a national level. My involvement in such case-competitions is what sparked an interest in exploring the depths of consulting and I hope to do so while applying my skills and expertise at SCOPE.","As an industrial engineering major, I have always been amazed by the variety of job roles I get to choose from in my career. While most other majors have a limited and restrictive list to choose from, industrial engineers can choose from technical roles, logistics roles, analyst roles, and even consulting roles. While I enjoy applying myself in a technical environment, I have always had an interest in the financial aspect of the technical decisions made in a project. This is one of my major reasons for pursuing a major in economics as well. I want to apply my technical and financial knowledge in a place where I can make a genuine impact. The opportunity to do so while working with talented and like-minded peers at is what I plan to gain from this experience at SCOPE. As a result-driven person, I am highly motivated by seeing my work having a real impact and experiencing that during my time at SCOPE will be a huge gain for me. Through this experience, I also want to gain a better understanding of how consulting works before I can dive into a career in consulting.","Purdue Website, Email",,No

Back in high school, I was a three time state winner and 4 time national qualifier in DECA, a club where I worked to create innovative solutions to different problems within different scenarios. DECA gave me my first interest in entrepreneurship and innovation which I eventually took as a sign to go into engineering. However, my desire to pursue more abstract problems and develop innovative solutions to larger-scale problems never disappeared. This is the main reason why I want to join SCOPE. I want to be part of a team that solves business problems. I want to improve some of my technical and entrepreneurial skills. Most importantly, I want to be surrounded by similarly-minded individuals that I can work hard with and enjoy the rewards with. ","In high school, I actually went through the entire product development cycle in creating a project for the annual Entrepreneurship Innovation Plan competition.

I want to work in a technological field in the form of consulting to gain experience for my future, as it is a field that I am looking into. I also strongly believe in Scopes's motto about building the leaders of tomorrow because cultivating our communication and leadership skills at an earlier stage can help us by giving us a foundation and preparing us for the future.

I spoke with many different people in a variety of business jobs (accounting, human resources, finance, marketing, sales, and consulting) and felt like I found where I belonged after speaking to a couple of consultants. I love the fast-paced environment and client contact that consultants get to experience. As well as the teamwork required to complete projects. From here, I researched the consulting clubs available at Purdue and found SCOPE Consulting. SCOPE Consulting’s contact with real clients and opportunities to work on solutions and deliverables is why I am interested in joining. I appreciate that many of the clients are local to the Purdue area, allowing the club to have a positive impact on our Purdue community.","My unique major will allow me to bring a different perspective to SCOPE Consulting. Biomedical Health Sciences is a mixture of public health and hard sciences, giving me critical thinking practice in a wide array of academic studies. Further, my background in toxicology research has given me practice with problem-solving, working with excel, creating slide decks, and presenting results to people from many different backgrounds. I also have had experiences in many different backgrounds of business. I have had a marketing internship, an accounting internship, led an entrepreneurship club at Purdue, and had a large involvement with Business Professional of America in high school. All these different exposures to business have led to a unique viewpoint when it comes to thinking through problems. Finally, my ability to work with a team and within a team would make me a good member of SCOPE Consulting. I am comfortable leading groups, but also know when to let someone else take the lead.","From this experience, I hope to gain knowledge about how a consultant works through a project from start to finish. More specifically, I want to experience the back and forth with a client to create solutions that work for their business model and create and present deliverables. Further, from this experience, I want to meet other hard-working Purdue students who are interested in a consulting career and learn as much from them as I possibly can.",Accounting Professor,,
1/22/2023 23:59:20,,,Freshman,May 2026,Computer Science,,,Yes,No,Yes,Girls Who Code - 1 Hour ,"I am interested in joining SCOPE Consulting because its ideals of accountability, diversity, and passion align with my own personal views and work ethic. While I am a Computer Science major, I've always been curious about how I could combine technology with business. Given that consulting is the nexus between data analytics, engineering, and business, I believe SCOPE can provide me with the tools to pursue my interests in these three areas. Joining SCOPE means gaining real-world experience that I could not get in the classroom. With a supportive and dedicated team, I will be able to tackle problems head-on and overcome any challenges that may arise. Furthermore, I value SCOPE's commitment to diversity. Consulting presents a wide range of issues, and having a variety of perspectives from people with different majors and backgrounds can encourage the team to create creative solutions and raise social awareness. ","The SCOPE consulting process begins with defining a timeline for goals, developing possible solutions, implementing final deliverables, and lastly closing the project. While the client only sees the final output, the journey to get there requires critical thinking, communication, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities. I believe I have all these skills that I can bring to SCOPE, as well as offer a fresh perspective on how to approach problems presented to us. Through my extracurricular activities in high school, I’ve conducted numerous interviews and webinars with various STEM professionals, allowing me to hone soft skills such as time management and networking. If something went wrong during these events, I would have to adapt and come up with thoughtful questions to ask the interviewees on the spot. Furthermore, my role as a tutor at Kumon taught me how to build relationships with students, parents, and supervisors. I understand how to work well within a group and talk with confidence when speaking to others.  Aside from these qualities, I have some coding experience with Java and Python, which will allow me to quickly grasp the syntax of other languages if necessary. Additionally, I believe my enthusiasm and passion for SCOPE Consulting can compensate for any lack of experience. I am prepared to meet the challenges and overcome them with teamwork and dedication. ","I hope to gain a new perspective on how to handle difficult business problems and unlock a side of technology that I wouldn't have discovered otherwise in the classroom. Consulting is a continuous learning process because it involves problems from fields I would not normally interact with, such as agriculture, medicine, or aviation. Developing solutions for these clients requires research that broadens my knowledge and teaches me new skills that I can apply in different scenarios or environments. Additionally, SCOPE's commitment to diversity will enable me to create a network of people from all over the world, allowing me to grasp the cultural differences that exist in business. The combination of work diversity and teamwork will accelerate my professional and personal development through the technical and soft skills I will master during my time as a consultant.
