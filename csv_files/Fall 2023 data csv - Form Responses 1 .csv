During high school, I realized my passion for economics revealing the potential that lies in consultingâ€”a path that harmoniously blends my passion for both CS and Economics. My ambition is to bring about a revolutionary change by crafting solutions that are not only technically sound but also economically viable.
 
 I aspire to join SCOPE Consulting as it offers a platform to delve into the consulting field, enrich my understanding of business and economics, and further hone my technological skill set. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to collaborate with fellow members, exchanging knowledge and collectively expanding our expertise.","My coding journey commenced at the age of 11 and has since grown into a profound passion, leading me through a diverse array of experiences that have enriched my skill set. As a result, I offer a substantial collection of skills, expertise, and knowledge that would greatly benefit SCOPE Consulting and its team.
 In the realm of technical proficiency, I have amassed a wealth of experience through engagement in numerous hackathons, the creation of personal projects, and my involvement in professional app development. My expertise extends to crafting web apps using NodeJS and ExpressJS, as well as creating cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter. In addition, my mastery of Python, honed over a span of 4+ years, equips me to tackle a wide spectrum of challenges. 
 
 My achievements and leadership roles have further refined my abilities. As a national finalist at the esteemed Toyota Hackathon held at IIT-Delhi, I have demonstrated my aptitude for thriving in competitive technical environments. My role as President of the school's tech club exemplified my leadership capabilities, guiding the team to secure more than 150 awards and 6 overall trophies in more than 15 events. I was also the lead student organizer of Robotronics, an inter-school tech symposium that saw over 500 participants from 30+ schools. I was responsible for coordination among all stakeholders, communication between the host school and participants, and ensuring an overall smooth functioning of the event. A passion for sustainability has guided my endeavors as well. Through a data analytics project focused on electricity consumption at my school, I conducted a comprehensive analysis spanning consumption from both fossil fuels and renewable sources. The project further encompassed an assessment of the impact of solar panels, energy-saving initiatives, and LED installations. This initiative garnered recognition through a certificate of merit bestowed by the Honourable President of India, Smt Droupadi Murmu.

SCOPE provides real-world consulting experience which I will use to develop my consulting expertise and my understanding of the industries I work with. SCOPE provides the unique experience of directly working with clientele. In my previous consulting positions, I reported solely to my project leads, with little interaction with client representatives. I hope to gain experience in initiating and developing projects with the clients themselves. Furthermore, I will collaborate with like-minded people from diverse backgrounds who genuinely enjoy developing solutions while bringing unique perspectives to the team. I consider this a strength because it enables me to become more flexible, understanding, and adaptive to both my team at SCOPE and the clients we serve. However, I understand that I must bring my full effort and workmanship to the SCOPE team. Above all else, I want to leave SCOPE better off than when I joined. ","I have previous experience in a boutique business management consulting firm, wherein I Reviewed and validated the discrepancies in over 150 contracts between an acquired FBO network and partnered airlines during an acquisition; composed and presented findings and recommendations to solve the contract discrepancies to a lead director of the acquiring FBO network; integrated over 500 vendor identities and expenditures between two leading flight support companies; developed real time models to determine cost-effective aviation fuel suppliers for fixed-base operators; and organized a country-wide promotional air tour. 

Furthermore, I am currently participating in a variety of research positions. I am working with New York University to determine the relation between kidney quality and transplant turnover rate. I am also collaborating with a professor at Purdue University to develop methodologies which predict consumer preferences based on the decisions they make and the products available to them.

Lastly, I am collaborating with a leading cybersecurity firm to combine both qualitative and quantitative risk factors. 

My experience in model development, particularly in predictive analytics boosts SCOPE's ability to apply evidence-based data to optimize and improve client operations, especially in route management and market analysis. 

Likewise, I can use my past expertise in mergers and acquisitions, specifically regarding contract management and vendor integration to help SCOPE take on new project opportunities in business management.","I wish to gain three key abilities by joining the SCOPE Consulting team. 

First, I desire to grow as a team member and as consultant. SCOPE will enable me to collaborate with a wide variety of consultants with unique perspectives and individual worldviews. My exposure and participation with the SCOPE team will encourage me to constantly adapt, think both critically and on my feet, and to adopt new ways of thinking on how to approach both projects and people. 

Second, I wish to put my methodological research into practice. I will be able to apply my applications to projects at SCOPE, which gives me the excellent opportunity to further refine and develop my research in the consumer analytics and operations fields. 

Last, I hope to refine my presentational and conversational abilities when addressing clients and team members. I will cherish the time I wish to spend at SCOPE communicating with project leads and clients, because I will gain a higher understanding of ways to concisely convey detail-oriented information.",Email,

 Two examples of how this quality has helped me in the past is during a particularly challenging project at my engineering class. My team was conformed from people of all different backgrounds and mindsets. This project lasted 2 months in the making and it had many stages where we had to work together and settle down agreements. Additionally, during the job I had over the summer as a production intern managing a project on how to reduce wooden pallets for packaging services, this was more of an investigative project where I had to talk to a variety of people from different areas and every time I spoke to a worker, a challenge appears. And every time I thought I had it all figured out, it turns I had not.

 Secondly, the applications of software in even the most unimaginable of places is super exciting, admirable, and inspiring to say the least.

 Additionally, I enjoy working on different problem spaces, alongside taking ideas and concepts from one space and applying them in another. When pursuing internships or personal projects, I am always looking to broaden my knowledge base and experience different business functions and problems. With this opportunity at Scope, I would be able to do just that, while also enriching upon my prior industry experience and building bonds with like-minded individuals to constitute a valuable experience through SCOPE.","To SCOPE and my team, I can bring both technical and nontechnical knowledge.

Management consulting and general consulting are great options and SCOPE consulting gives me a special opportunity to simulate how these occupations will be. In addition to this, if I do decide that I want to pursue consulting, SCOPE has case competitions, JE Summit, a strong network for me to learn from. SCOPE will allow me to work on projects that I can speak passionately about in interviews, and there is evidence that SCOPE places well. As a freshman, the experience I will build from SCOPE will put me on the career trajectory that I want.","I have a history of working with clients. I acquired my own clients by using Nextdoor, Whatsapp, and Facebook for both private basketball coaching and private math tutoring. In addition to this, I negotiated prices with parents to ensure a healthy client relationship.

Research: 4-6 hours","A big reason why SCOPE consulting is an intriguing junior enterprise to apply to is the real life decision making aspect of it and the thought process behind it. Every company has difficult decisions that they have to make with the goal of creating profit. I am interested in learning the process on how to make the best possible decision while also providing valuable input. One fact that excites me is the fact that SCOPE works with companies and uses real life scenarios in their cases and projects. I am excited to see how decisions are accessed and ultimately how a final verdict is reached. Another aspect which interests me is networking, within and outside of SCOPE. In SCOPE, members come from all over the world and are in multiple different majors. I would be thrilled to get to know more about how others go about solving problems by working with them and how their experiences and expertise help us reach a solution. Outside of SCOPE, in a professional setting, exploring jobs and meeting people in them will be helpful in exploring different career paths and understanding what it takes to be a professional.","As an engineering student, throughout my first year of school, we worked in teams in most of my classes such as engineering, physics, and computer science. I used good teamwork skills such as doing my part, making sure everyone knew what was going on, and giving and receiving feedback. I believe that everyone's voice is important and that everyone’s ideas should be taken into consideration. This ensures that we have multiple different and unique perspectives on a situation which is important in consulting. In my early years of high school, I participated in a club similar to SCOPE called LaunchX which was a entrepreneurship club. My team’s idea was to create an app that tracks school bus locations so that children don't have to stand in the cold or rain while waiting for their bus. We gave multiple presentations to other teams and even designed an app. While working with my SCOPE team I can apply what I learned in LaunchX to provide prior experience and further help out my team. ","No matter what major you're in, having valuable professional skills can go a long way. Skills such as communication, problem solving, creativity, and being a good leader are extremely important as we move further into college and professional life. I hope to strengthen these skills through tackling real world scenarios in various disciplines such as engineering, computer science, and business. Through multiple cases and projects, I hope to gain valuable knowledge of how to deal with real life scenarios and improve my efficiency in the way to go about solving them. Additionally, working with local companies creates a professional workplace environment where we can tackle and analyze problems and help come up with solutions. This environment will be a job like experience where I will better understand how companies work. ","Purdue Website, Lohit Bhatnagar",

Firstly, I am extremely interested in business, and I am considering a minor in finance in the near future. With business, and specifically business optimization, being a love of mine, I am excited about the fact that I can combine my major and my passions in such an easy way. When I found this club at the Purdue Club Fair, the club was well-explained and seemed extremely inviting. I felt like I could make an impact on that club, especially in the data analytics field. Data is extremely important and needs to analyzed when working with businesses and consulting. The work I am doing with the Data Mine as well as what I learn in my classes can be put to great use with SCOPE Consulting. More importantly, I want to work with like-minded individuals who can see the business and data side when coming up with real-world solutions, so this club attracts me a lot.","My mentality, personality, and skillset allow me to bring much to SCOPE Consulting. Firstly, I have been immersed in data for years. I have worked on high-scale projects with universities, such as Kean University, that were tested on software worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. My role in these projects included me being able to analyze data and put it to good use, in order to prevent automobile accidents in the future. In addition to this project, I analyzed extremely large datasets of words in order to analyze if AI on Twitter could interpret the sentiment of tweets, and to find business solutions to such issues so that firms/individuals would not be affected by incorrect sentiment analysis. Overall, I have spent many years of the latter half of my life working with data analytics, and have also dug deep into business solutions and optimization, and my project experience has set me up to do well with SCOPE Consulting.","Since this is my first year at Purdue, this experience will truly set me up for the working world. I am not too sure where I will end up in life, but I see myself working in a similar field regarding business and data, rather than strictly computers and software. This club is in particular important for me because it combines both my passions. Additionally, working with the upperclassmen and other firms will be significant, as I can take many tips from them. Specifically, I am excited to meet other consultants and learn from them. I also like how this club is very work-oriented, being almost like a 9-5 but not as long. It will truly prepare me for all the internships and jobs I can get during and after college. Also, I think that SCOPE will teach me how to maximize usage of data in an effective manner.

 1. Business 
 I am experienced in marketing, social media, and operations through my involvement in various non-profit projects/ventures. I have worked two internships in digital marketing and social media outreach to increase engagement and then also expand audience by catering content to a specific demographic. I have operations experience from multiple ventures. One of my favourites being organising a ration drive to provide covid relief for waste pickers. I coordinated the partnership with the NGO, managed the entire drive ( locations + logistics) as well managing the volunteer team. I was also a TEDxPurdueU logistics committee member last year.
 Although it is completely unrelated to my major, it is weirdly a niche I enjoy, and I am constantly watching educational content on marketing as a hobby. These roles are fairly intuitive for me. 
 2. Engineering
 It is directly related to my major and is one I am constantly growing in. 
 3. Data Analytics 
 Almost all my classes this semester involve statistics and data. One of my classes is ' data visualisation and inference'. I will also be working with data analytics and image processing in my VIP research team this semester which focuses on IoT sensors in manufacturing. The more I get into it, the more my interest is growing in this domain. I also did a programming internship this summer, and can work on front-end development ( react native, JS). I am fairly skilled at Matlab as well if needed to interpret data.","I am exploring consulting as an industry and I guess I want to understand it better through the various professional and networking opportunities/events provided such as case competitions, workshops etc. I also want to grow my skillset because the more I read about the work involved and skills required, the more it seems like a match for me as an IE+Econ student. Having always been interested in business and engineering, I am excited to apply engineering skills in business projects and vice-versa. I really want to push myself to learn and be involved in unconventional projects that are exploring new pathways such as artificial intelligence and building tools the way the Anu team did. I want to grow to be a leader in the organisation which is really important to me because I see myself being a leader in my job. Lastly, I can tell the students in this organisation are extremely talented and will offer me diverse knowledge.

No, I'm not referring to them being consultants. While that's probably true, what I am actually referring to are analytical people. People that can make the most optimal decision given a dataset. People that can piece together a strategy in their head as they converse with their clients. It's not being a consultant that makes them special, although consulting is a profession that requires you to have these traits. Being someone who values helping others alongside being a data-driven person, joining Scope only seems natural.

Some experiences I have regarding these skills include my time leading the marketing department of a startup, being assigned Chair of Web Development at Purdue ECESS, and my work with a supervised learning team in The Data Mine. During my time at the startup, I navigated intricate cross-functional projects, fostering effective communication between teams to achieve shared goals. My engagement with ECESS and The Data Mine has primarily deepened my technical expertise, which I am eager to apply extensively at Scope.

Relative to the other consulting clubs at Purdue, SCOPE is far more diverse. With diversity comes a myriad of different perspectives and points of view that enhance productivity, efficiency, and quality of work compared to narrow-minded approaches. Additionally, I’m enticed by SCOPE’s diversity of clientele. SCOPE’s past clients, for example, Boiler Vintage, Indie Coffee Roasters, and Cordian Technologies, represent a vast array of industries namely, food/beverage, clothing, and even the intersection of the technology and medical sectors. Finally, SCOPE’s focus on local businesses as well as its commitment to serving non-profit organizations such as Shine On University and LTHC excite me because I will be able to serve my community and witness firsthand the tangible impact of my work. I had the great opportunity of speaking to Haley and other members of the club who shared personal stories attesting to SCOPE’s camaraderie and positive work environment. These anecdotes tell the story of a SCOPE experience that doesn’t segregate work from fun, and that’s a community I want to be part of. ","In high school, I volunteered at Advocate Sherman Hospital. I was heavily involved in the day-to-day operations and often worked as an assistant for administrative staff in addition to my assigned duties. Following around a senior manager for weeks provided me with a firsthand account of all the components required to keep one of the most premier regional hospitals in the country a well-oiled machine. The insights I gained working at Advocate Sherman can translate to SCOPE because, despite the ethical issues, hospitals do follow a for-profit model. The ingredients of Advocate Sherman’s successful business model are the missing pieces for which clients seek consulting services. Some of these pieces include operations and staff management, regulatory and compliance knowledge, quality assurance, marketing, and even simple cost-benefit analysis that goes into day-to-day decision-making. Watching and helping administrators execute these skills on a large scale leaves me confident that I will be able to bring expertise regarding the essential components of a successful business and use this knowledge to help clients achieve their goals. My experience at Advocate Sherman has provided me with the foundational business acumen that I am eager to expand upon through professional development through SCOPE. ","I hope to grow both personally and professionally from this experience. Regarding my professional aspirations, I hope to better prepare myself for real-world opportunities after I graduate. In other words, I’m seeking professional development, whether that be through acquiring skills such as thorough market research and social media strategy, learning the art of slide design and presentation, or even how to conduct myself appropriately in business settings and display professionalism. In addition to this professional development, I hope to develop casing and networking skills strong enough to land myself an internship in the coming summers. My personal goal is to join a collaborative community of ambitious individuals with similar interests. I hope to make friends with other members, not just within the confines of club meetings or events, but friends to go to football games with, enjoy a cup of coffee with, and maybe someday even live with. Having similar interests will allow us to help each other grow personally and professionally, potentially developing friendships that don’t expire when we are handed our diplomas. Finally, I hope to contribute back to the club, helping it grow in the coming years by putting forth my full effort into recruiting new talent and advising underclassmen members once I become an upperclassman. I aspire to be a part of the board and expand the club’s presence on campus in the coming years, ultimately building a strong, active alumni network by the time I graduate.","Instagram, Purdue Website, B-involved fair ",

I also have extensive tutoring experience, which I believe could be of use as I planned lessons and accounted for my students' needs during each lesson, something that could translate over to consulting and considerations of companies' needs.","I am not only eager to enter the world of consulting, but also to gain a lot of experience in working alongside a team of driven individuals.

Those clubs will most likely have a low time commitment of one hour or so. ","I found out about SCOPE Consulting at the Be-Involved Fair, during which I walked through every single table and looked at what was probably at least 100 organizations. In a sea of opportunities, SCOPE Consulting stood out to me for several reasons. 
There were several clubs I saw that involved completing various projects, but didn’t include the opportunity to work with actual companies. I love the opportunity in SCOPE Consulting to create relations with companies in West Lafayette and help the local community thrive. 
In addition, I loved a lot of subjects in high school and really struggled to choose the one thing I liked. I’m not sure what I have in mind for a career, but I know I want it to involve several different types of fields. SCOPE Consulting will give me the opportunity to dive deeper into the intersections between disciplines and explore consulting as a career. 
I’m also interested in the Marketing Committee. In high school, I created and designed Instagram posts for my school’s music honors society and I’d like to continue social media outreach. 
Finally, I eventually want to pursue a minor in business or a business related field.","     In high school, I participated in the DECA (or Distributive Education Clubs of America) business competition. The competition I primarily competed in was Integrated Marketing Campaign. In this competition, I worked with fellow team members to plan and present a marketing campaign for a local business. In senior year, my group and I placed 3rd at the state competition, earning us a spot at the International Competition. I also earned 5th place in the test portion of my event. 
     That year, my marketing campaign was about a local Bubble Tea business. To create a plan that would increase the social media presence of the company, I researched the surrounding area and market of my city and took notes of everything, including population size, surrounding competitors, and even the company’s most popular Instagram posts in the past two years. I also worked on writing the speech for my presentation and practiced my poise and confidence.
While looking at the “Spring 2023 Semester Yearbook” on Scope’s website, I found that many of the projects involved keeping track of large amounts of data. This is something that I keep in practice in my daily life. In my senior year, I was responsible for setting up tutoring sign-up spreadsheets for a 100+ person Honors Society at my school. I would even send reminder emails to students to remind them to show up for their tutoring time. 
In addition, I did a second DECA event last year which involved managing a virtual hotel simulation. Each simulation took an average of six hours to complete, as I carefully wrote down the trends that the hotel took on as my team members and I adjusted employee prices, room rates, and even advertising. The process paid off though, as my group and I placed in the top 16% of teams nationally, as well as first in the state. 

     Developing my presentation, data analysis, and business skills over the years has led to some truly incredible experiences. From going to the DECA International Competition and getting to meet others who were interested in business to seeing the appreciation from the school that I helped organize tutoring for, the work that I did to prepare for these things is something I would never take back. And I am excited to use my skills to help companies succeed in SCOPE. ","I became a Computer Science major because I fell in love with solving coding problems. My AP Computer Science A class was one of my favorite times of the day. No matter what was going on, I could sit there and use 110% of myself to work through coding problems that I didn’t understand. The feeling of success after I had worked through one problem for the entire 48 minutes of class made the journey to get there even more incredible. 
	However, one negative stereotype about CS majors is that they sit there in silence, doing problem sets holed up in their rooms. But I think pursuing outside outreach and collaboration opportunities is especially important in a tech industry, and I hope to use the experience and resources gained through SCOPE to get lifelong connections and career experience. 
I’ve always sought out ways to improve my presentation and communication skills. From presenting my research in my AP Research class to becoming the Vice President of my school’s Math Honors Society and addressing the room during meetings, I’ve fallen in love with improving this skill. 
In addition, I look forward to networking with other companies and professionals during some of SCOPE’s events, such as the Consulting Career Fair. 
Finally, I am interested in seeing the intersection of CS and business up-close in a more real-world format and to see the possibilities that are available if/when I decided to pursue a minor in business. ",B-Involved Fair,Thank you so much for taking the time to review my application.
