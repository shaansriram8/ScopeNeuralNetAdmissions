expected_graduation: 2026-05-01 00:00:00
major: First Year Engineering
previous_applicant: False
willing_to_commit: True
tuesday_conflicts: False
on_campus: True
extracurricular_activities: This semester, I plan on being involved in the following extracurricular activities:

-Electrical and Computer Engineering Student Society (3-5 hours a week)

-Purdue ISA (1-2 hours a week)

-TA/SI sessions (3 hours a week)

interest_reason: Though only recently discovering SCOPE Consulting, my interest in providing business solutions started in my sophomore year of High School when I helped launch my first business. Teaming up with other motivated students, we worked as a group to develop our product and create strategies for distribution. Though we all had our designated roles (marketing, accounting, etc.), we were all working to answer the big question: How can we improve our business? Though in the past now, my interest in SCOPE Consulting draws me back to experiences like these. Having always been interested in problem solving, combining this with my business acumen seemed very enticing to me. With SCOPE's projects such as Nutra Maize and Continuum Apartments being heavily focused on marketing and analytics, my previous role in my business, I found myself very interested in creating solutions for similar clients. With the wide variety of projects SCOPE takes on, I believe that I will not only learn a lot about the nuances of consulting but also be of aid to both SCOPE and its partners.
skills_expertise: With years of experience in debate club, FBLA, Shark Tank style business competitions, and my time starting my own successful business, the skills I picked up along the way have shown to be of great value. I have always prided myself on having great communication skills and the ability to become friends with anyone. I believe teamwork to be one of the greatest strengths a group can have, and my experience leading teams through club leadership or project-based environments have taught me a lot about it. One thing to note about me, however, is that soft skills are not the only things I believe I can offer to SCOPE Consulting. As an engineer and aspiring math double major, my quantitative skills are up to par as well. With consulting combining these two aspects, I know my years of exposure to the composition that goes into supporting a successful business/team will be of aid to my teammates at SCOPE Consulting. To summarize, I wish to bring my teamwork, communication, and quantitative/reasoning skills to help clients at SCOPE.
expected_gains: By joining SCOPE Consulting, I hope to delve into the world of professional consulting and learn how to better provide business solutions while also helping clients. By increasing my knowledge in this area, I know it will benefit both my professional and personal life. Most of all, however, I look forward to creating lifelong connections with all the members at SCOPE.

previous_applicant: False
willing_to_commit: True
tuesday_conflicts: False
on_campus: True
extracurricular_activities: Sigma Phi Epsilon Executive Board - 4 hours, Purdue Powerlifting - 1 hour
interest_reason: I attended a callout for SCOPE last semester and learned a lot about the benefits in a career in consulting from the entrepreneur that presented. Having since learned more about SCOPE and consulting as a whole, I am now hoping to make the jump to becoming a consultant, and am particularly interested in the Operations and Supply Chain work SCOPE does. Supply Chain work has been the most interesting field within Industrial Engineering for me ever since I learned about the major, and I aspire to start a Supply Chain Consulting or Logistics Management firm later in my career. Getting involved in SCOPE is a great way for me to learn more about how consulting works and to build my skills in the services SCOPE provides their clients.
skills_expertise: I come to SCOPE with significant leadership and project management experiences as the president of my high school robotics club and vice president of learning communities in my fraternity. I believe these traits along with an engineering problem-solving mindset makes me a strong consultant because it allows me to communicate fluidly with customers and team members and understand any technical aspects of a project. Additionally, I am highly interested in a number of the fields SCOPE works in, so my skills could be used on a variety of projects. Despite being a first year engineer, I have experience with Industrial Engineering coursework and problem sets, as I took a IE overview course the summer after my junior year through the University of Tennessee Knoxville.
expected_gains: Participating in SCOPE will give me opportunities to practice consulting before I venture into the professional world, both to ensure that I am interested in the field and to gain the skills I will need to be successful in it. The professional development resources SCOPE provides will also help me secure a job in consulting. I believe the club's affiliation with Junior Enterprise puts SCOPE in a unique position to collaborate and learn outside of the boundaries of Lafayette. Aside from direct professional experiences, having a strong and diverse network is the best way to propel my career. Joining SCOPE would help me broaden my network significantly, providing me with numerous connections in Purdue, the IE space, and the professional world based on the clients I would work with.

interest_reason: By joining a fine club such as SCOPE consulting, I want to broaden my college experience and make it more holistic. My major (engineering) is often assumed to be extremely technical, indicating a lack of other skills such as leadership, teamwork and business management. I want to change this narrative and investigate the managerial side of engineering, which is why I plan on joining SCOPE consulting and choosing Industrial engineering as my major. I am highly interested in joining this club because it would allow me to develop problem solving skills, network and interact with a diverse group of like minded people.
skills_expertise: I believe I would be an asset to SCOPE consulting because of my work ethic and my determination to achieve my goals. Additionally, being an international student gives me an edge over others because my perspective and thinking differ highly from domestic students. I would be able to incorporate diversity and effectively work with others on the team in a productive manner.
expected_gains: I believe SCOPE consulting will foster skills such as time management, problem solving and collaboration. Additionally, it will allow me to expand my horizons and take a role which would not be directly related to my major offering me plenty of space to grow and learn from others. I also believe that since SCOPE consulting houses people from different majors and backgrounds, I would gain a lot from being on the team.

extracurricular_activities: International Marketing Intern of Krannert School of Management, 10 hours
Business Analyst Course, 3 hours
Volunteer events (not weekly), 0-1 hours
interest_reason: Firstly, I am enthusiastic in all sorts of data analysis, because by organizing and processing the raw data, I can make better decision, which gives me a sense of accomplishment. For example, I am currently an international marketing intern at Krannert. In my job, I analyze Krannert’s international market, especially its Chinese market, and conduct user and content analysis of Purdue’s Chinese social media accounts. Using my analysis result, I could improve the content of Purdue’s WeChat and Weibo accounts to optimize its user experience and expand the influence, which makes me feel that my work is meaningful and worthwhile. Similarly, if I join SCOPE Consulting, I will have the opportunity to apply my analytics skills to different real life business case, which is really exiting to me. Secondly, I am an international student from China. I really enjoy living and working in a multicultural environment. At SCOPE, I can meet a lot of people from different countries and cultural background, which is very cool! Finally, I knew clearly that I wanted to pursue a career in consulting and business analytics, and SCOPE can equip me with the knowledge and experience needed in this field. Thus, I really want to join the club.
skills_expertise: Firstly, I have strong analytics skill and ability to solve problems. In my sophomore year, I did research on the Impact of Household Consumption Behavior on Household Carbon Footprint with a senior student. At that time, I have only moderate Microsoft Excel skills and the ability to process data with STATA, but through learning and researching online, I successfully sorted and analyzed 37,354 observations in China Family Panel Studies and derived household archetypes representing each type of consumption pattern. In my junior year, I applied to be a research assistant for the SOA U.S. Mortality Data Survey project through Professor Xu. In this project, we were responsible for processing the data downloaded on the CDC website. But the process of querying data was so tedious, so I and my partner did thorough research on Google and YouTube, and learned Python packages including pandas, os, and sleep by ourselves, and successfully implemented automatic query, download, and data sorting with Python programs. Through these experiences, I have better mastered excel, stata and python. At the same time, I am learning about R and Tableau. Secondly, I have some experiences in market and business case analysis. I am currently an international marketing intern at Krannert, where I conduct market analysis and research. Recently, I signed up for the course of case analysis. Now, I have written one case study of Xiaomi Inc.
expected_gains: First and foremost, although I have some experience in the field of analysis, I have never participated in a project of an enterprise in real life, so I really value the real market consulting experience provided by SCOPE Consulting. Secondly, I just transferred from China last semester, and I think my time at Purdue is much shorter than others. I really hope to have the chance of networking and making friends. I think I can meet many people who share my interests in SCOPE, and the diverse environment in SCOPE makes me feel relaxed and comfortable.

extracurricular_activities: I am an engineer for the Command and Data Handling team of Purdue Space Program's CubeSat, I am a marketing analyst for Brasa Purdue and I am a collaborator at Dr. Chopra's research lab.
interest_reason: I am very enthusiastic towards projects that require an analysis of all the possible solutions in order to determine the best path to take. One of my strengths is logic, as evidenced by my majors, and I see consulting as extremely logic based, where we are logically thinking over what the options are, the benefits and risks, so that the option with the most benefits and the least risks can be taken. Furthermore, I prefer to work on projects that have clear final product that can be measured to determine its success. In consulting projects, I will deliver the final product to the client, and they will return to me an evaluation of the performance. This way, I can have a feedback that I can use to be constantly improving.
skills_expertise: I think one of my most prominent skills is adaptability, which means I will easily fit into the Scope environment. Additionally, I am very thorough when developing a project and I always try to think of how to improve every aspect of my project. This means I will only do high quality work, and try to leave the smallest possible room for potentials errors that are inevitable when dealing with a client. When developing a solution for a client, for example, I will make sure to research every possible solution and analyze what each of them has to offer, the pros and cons, and how the client will react to the benefits and the risks. As far as expertise goes, I interned at a Brazilian startup from July 2021 to September 2022, where I got work on a computer science team. This experience allowed me to develop my collaborative skills, as well as expand my computer science knowledge. Moreover, not only did I develop important skills, I also understood to an extent how a startup works, the struggles startup owners go through, and the day to day life of a startup worker.
expected_gains: I hope to understand what it is like to work in collaboration with a company, how to deal with the clients expectations, and I hope to develop critical thinking by engaging in challenging projects that require a thorough evaluation.

I am person who is willing to learn new concepts, skills and software and apply them to bring about efficient solutions to problems. I was also in charge for leading the manufacturing team in my lab to meet the weekly deadlines.

extracurricular_activities: I am part of the American India Foundation Club (AIF) - 2 hours/week. 
I am also part of a Research Team with an ECE professor - 3 hours/week. 
interest_reason: I think my biggest takeaway from the callout was Scope’s emphasis on synchronized personal and professional development for members. Right from the case interview process, we are encouraged to work in a team and tested not only individual strengths but interacting with teammates and arriving at collaborative decisions, as well as backing those decisions during presentation. To me, that reflects the conducive environment of the club. The breadth of industries Scope consults will further make my experience multifaceted across company departments, with diverse business models and needs. Moreover, reading about Scope’s association with the Junior Global Enterprise, I am looking forward to gaining direct access to a nation-wide network for entrepreneurs, and interacting with these industry experts and gaining skills of negotiation and decision-making. Lastly, as discussed in the callout, though my coursework is heavily tech-focused, the flexibility with project department opportunities at Scope, really allows me to comfortably explore different fields of consulting.
skills_expertise: The culmination of projects and coursework I’ve taken up over the past three semesters have helped me realize I’ve enjoyed elements which serve as the basis of consulting. My time in EPICS as a Design Lead was a pseudo-PM experience, where technical specifications weren’t the biggest challenge, rather consistent communication to address a myriad of barriers (language/resource/skilled labor) was. Most importantly, client exposure With the cushion of advisors, I significantly developed my thinking philosophy and dialogue skills (particularly, asking the right questions) through the project. I intend to take this to the next level with Scope Consulting, where the added independence and accountably for my work will be a delightful challenge.
expected_gains: I’d like to see myself discover an engagement (skill, career, etc.) which I truly enjoy pursuing. College has put me in a consistent reflective journey, and as of now, I’ve arrived at the conclusion that consulting has all the elements I could pick to merge into one ideal pursuit. It’s fast paced, heavily dependent on the confluence of interpersonal and technical knowledge. Moreover, finding a community of individuals to learn from and work with on an experience which simulates real-world work experience will help me get accustomed to workplace expectations personally. Lastly, it’s the consistent and unscripted learning curve in consulting that gives me the freedom to take my career where I want it to be, and that’s exactly what I want to gain from this experience.

As mentioned in the callout I went to, there are many engineering-related projects at SCOPE that would really help me hone my problem-solving skills and help me learn about the field of consulting in general. I believe that by joining this club as a freshman, I can use my time at SCOPE to understand how engineering is applicable to many people and businesses and make positive change in the community with what I learn at Purdue and from my SCOPE teammates.
skills_expertise: As a freshman, I haven't yet taken many classes related to engineering yet, but I'm currently taking ENGR 13100 and 13200 which is about learning how to problem solve as well as MATLAB and python. Outside of that, I have skills relating to statistics, problem-solving, visual design and I'm a very fast learner so I am willing to pick up new skills to best serve SCOPE. In the past, I worked a lot of problem solving on a robotics team for real world problems such as manned space-travel and water shortages. Through these robotics competitions, my team got to the national and world level in order to showcase our solutions to a panel of judges. These experiences taught me a lot about how to brainstorm effectively, how to communicate with experts in the field, and how to create effective and engaging presentations. Additionally, I have conducted research in high school with a mentor from Rice University in using Machine Learning Models to track movement behavior of baboons remotely. I also gained applicable research skills from that experience such as writing research reports and creating very technical presentations.
expected_gains: The SCOPE consulting club offers a great opportunity for me to learn about the world of consulting which is exactly what I'm looking for. I believe that SCOPE will be a great opportunity to work with my peers on real-world problems and solutions that benefit the community around us. I have a lot to learn about the consulting process, so my biggest goal in this club would be to soak up as much information as I can in order to expand my career options in the future.

extracurricular_activities: None as of 1/22/23, however I might join the Purdue chapter of ASCE.
interest_reason: I am interested in joining Scope because I would like to gain exposure to consulting, to experience working in a team developing solutions for clients, and to put my skills and knowledge to the test in a real-world environment. I first learned about consulting when I spoke to a cousin of mine who worked at Deloitte for several years after graduating college. Her team was contracted by the government, and she worked on important projects that helped the government make decisions. She told me that I should consider consulting, as it is not only interesting, but fun and rewarding as well. After a few semesters studying engineering, I feel as though consulting may be more geared towards my interests. I know that many engineering graduates end up in consulting jobs, so when I received the invitation to the Scope callout, I figured that this would be the perfect opportunity to see what consulting is all about. Working with peers in a student-led organization seems like the perfect environment to begin consulting, one in which I have much of the same responsibility as I would as a paid consultant, but without the pressures of corporate life.
skills_expertise: As someone who is biracial, I am comfortable working in a diverse environment because of my exposure to different cultures and countries. I have leadership skills that center around rallying a group towards a common cause or purpose. I also have strong presentation skills and I am good at interacting with people in a team. Furthermore, I didn't notice any other Civil Engineers at the callout, so I think I will bring a different technical perspective than some of the other engineers in Scope.
expected_gains: I wish to gain experience applying my skills and knowledge to solve real-world problems. I have experience presenting suggestions/potential solutions to a panel of transportation professionals; however, this presentation was in an academic setting, with no actual client involved. I wish to familiarize myself working for a client, because that is how business is conducted in the real world.

interest_reason: SCOPE Consulting provides me with opportunities to consult in a wide variety of fields. I always enjoy the process of learning something new. Every time I learned something I would connect it with other concepts I knew. It's really interesting to me to learn how different things can joint together. I don't like to do repetitive trivialities; instead, I like to challenge myself with something different. Consulting is, thus, my dream career and I intend to become a consulting actuary someday. I believe I will enjoy my time at SCOPE Consulting to learn from peers and think outside the box.
skills_expertise: My experience in handling large datasets using Excel and R can help SCOPE Consulting to analyze data, and identify problems.

interest_reason: I am interested in joining SCOPE Consulting because I want to pursue a second passion while using my technical skills and analytical mindset. SCOPE is a unique consulting firm, in which it provides services in business, engineering, and data analytics. Being a mechanical engineering major, engineering consulting intrigues me as I am keen to provide clients technical solutions, optimize their products, and develop prototypes. However, being interdisciplinary is key in the modern workforce. I look forward to expanding my knowledge in data analytics and business during my college career as well. Likewise, I am excited by the potential opportunity of being face to face with different clients. I enjoy the potential challenge of communicating with them to develop solutions to help their business.
skills_expertise: As an undergraduate researcher, I possess a lot of the qualities a consultant would. At the start of my research, I conducted a thorough literature review to understand my field of research (additive manufacturing of energetic materials) which is very similar to the problem scoping process in consulting. I have read through over 20 papers involving my field of research and was able to synthesize the information in a cohesive literature review in the introduction in my research paper during the Fall semester. Furthermore, I have weekly meetings with my research advisor to present my findings in my experiments as well as defend my conclusions. This process is very similar to having weekly meetings with a client and presenting solutions to them. During my research, I learned how to be coherent in my findings while finding the appropriate tone to effectively communicate my ideas. Likewise, I have worked on several engineering projects throughout my time at Purdue. These projects have given me lots of experience in product design, CAD modeling, and prototyping my final idea. During my sophomore capstone project, my group conducted an economic analysis on our product which presented the break-even point, the return on investment, and our profit margins. On top of my current engineering skills, I am actively pursuing more technical skills. I’ve participated in the Purdue Milestones in which I took the Intro to Programming an Arduino course and am currently taking courses in PCB design and Fusion 360. Furthermore, I’m nearing completion in my certificate in Python for Data Science. Moreover, I have worked in Chick-fil-a as a front of house team member. Therefore, I am well acquainted with the day-to-day operation of one of the best fast-food chains in the world. The day-to-day operation of a fast-food restaurant has commonalities with retail stores and sit-down restaurants which consists of a bulk of SCOPE’s clients. Therefore, I will bring a wealth of technical abilities to SCOPE consulting along with emotional intelligence of presenting solutions to clients in a clear and cohesive manner. Along with my current skills I will show the willingness to learn from the project lead and from my team members in order for us to collaborate and present the best solution to our client.
expected_gains: From this experience, I hope to gain a lot of interactions with different clients. Understanding a client’s need is crucial to any problem-solving process. Interacting with clients on a weekly basis will refine my emotional intelligence and communication skills as I speak with clients in my future job. Furthermore, I would like to have consulting experience on my resume as I aspire to apply for consulting positions in the future. Moreover, a personal goal of mine would be to open my own engineering consulting firm in which I assist engineering companies with their product design, and manufacturing process optimization.

additional_info: My best attribute is that I am calm. When the ship is sinking, I pride myself on getting a bucket rather than jumping off the ship. Therefore, whenever an issue arises, I never get anxious, and still maintain a level head to try to think of a solution. I feel this is important for any conflict resolution we may have between consultants or with the clients.

interest_reason: Consulting interests me because because I like the idea of working one-on-one with people to help solve a problem. I enjoy being able to see my impact directly, and with consulting I can. With SCOPE specifically, I like that it has varied types of consulting projects, whether that be in web design, advertising, data analytics in more. I often find myself getting bored if I am working on something for too long, so I love the idea of working on a project for a semester then moving on! Specifically, I am interested in the Groped energy project! From the callouts I’ve been too, I also love the atmosphere of the group. Members seem like they truly just want to help you and help the client, but they also seem fun!
skills_expertise: My biggest assets I can bring to SCOPE Consulting are my people skills, curiosity, and passion. I love working with people, I love connecting with people, I simply just love people. If you set me up with a client, a new business group, I can make conversation and feel extremely comfortable doing it. I genuinely love working with people, and I know that will come in handy when working with our clients, teammates, and more. At my job at the Women in Engineering Office, I find my favorite days are when we hold events for high schoolers. In the fall, we held an event where high school juniors and seniors, they learned about Purdue Engineering. My job was to chat with students, make them feel more comfortable, etc. I loved doing this, and a parent even mentioned me in a survey response later thanking me for how I was able to make her daughter more at ease with admissions decisions. I am a people person, through and through, which will be a strong asset for SCOPE consulting. I also enjoy learning new things, whether that be learning to make clothes because I was bored over break or learning how to CAD because no one else on my team knew how to. I like learning new things and I like acquiring new skills. I’m willing to put the work in because I want to be better, and I want SCOPE to be better. And last, I’m passionate! I once did a business pitch competition at Purdue, and I pitched a feminine products subscription box for teenage girls. I loved this experience because I was able to think critically, and I loved reaching out to people asking for their input and thoughts on our idea. My team and I worked hard to make our product idea sound, and we won the pitch competition! I’m passionate about consulting, because I love the idea of being able to help a business improve. I will bring that passion to SCOPE and will work hard to accomplish all goals.
expected_gains: I hope to develop my ability to problem solve and find a new community. Problem solving is not only an important part of engineering, but an important part of life, and I want to continuously improve that skill. This is the perfect opportunity to exercise that part of my brain, and plus I think it would be fun solving problems for companies. And I want to gain a community. At the callout, everyone seemed passionate about this club but also just fun to be around! Being in a cool community at such a big school sounds exciting.

additional_info: If I am not admitted to the club, I am happy to help out with whatever may be needed, whether that means needing someone to take notes or help with the website. This club is peaking my interest (a lot), so I am happy to do whatever that may be.

In addition, to what the club stands for, I was very interested in the different aspects of the club and how it combined business, engineering, and data analytics.

interest_reason: I currently envision my career headed towards the technology industry, with hopes of eventually becoming a technology consultant. I have always gotten excited when faced with a challenging programming problem. I find the process of brainstorming, designing, testing, and redesigning both challenging and fulfilling. I have also always been interested in the business aspect of technology companies, and I plan on minoring in economics. Scope consulting is the perfect opportunity to combine my passion for software engineering with real world business applications. I hope to join a project where I can use and developed my programming skillset to deliver a useful solution to a business. I am enticed by the possible opportunities to work with a team of diverse but likeminded individuals who are highly motivated, dedicated, and passionate about the work they produce. By surrounding myself with individuals who share similar values to my own, I hope to join a community that will challenge me while also allowing me to form new connections and friendships.
skills_expertise: Through my high school and early college career, I have collaborated on many projects that have provided me with invaluable experiences. I hope to bring some of the knowledge, skills, and expertise I gained from these projects to SCOPE. Currently, I am working on an EPICS engineering team to deliver an electrical pole storage solution for our community partner Habitats for Humanity. Working on this team, I have learned a lot about working with a partner to design a solution from scratch. Throughout last semester, I communicated with our partner to build specifications based off user needs, develop a project timeline, and work through the engineering process. Within my team of peers, I coordinated meeting times, created meeting agendas, documented team progress, and contributed to the research and brainstorming process. Additionally, I have some mild experience with social media marketing and sales strategies. In my senior year of high school, I worked at a local restaurant. The business was suffering from a lack of new customers. I helped the owner design a strategy to bring in more customers by establishing a social media presence and advertising special weekly deals. I also have some technical skills that may be useful to a SCOPE project. I have decent experience coding in the languages Python, Java, and MATLAB. I am currently self-teaching myself higher level Python concepts through personal projects using API data and basic Graphical User Interface technology. I also am a very comfortable public speaker. I have designed and presented seminars on basic leadership concepts to groups of around 70-100 peers on multiple occasions. I hope to bring these skillsets to a SCOPE team and help my peers learn and benefit from the experiences I’ve had, just as I hope to learn and grow from my fellow peers’ experiences.
expected_gains: By joining SCOPE, I hope to learn more of the business aspect of consulting, while developing my technical skills through one of the clubs’ projects. I am motivated by the idea that each project places a lot of accountabilities on the team members, so there is a clear standard that each member must put their absolute best work out. I hope to work with and learn from experienced individuals in and outside of the club. Additionally, I would love to get to know each member personally, form friendships and ask and learn about their other experiences at Purdue outside of the club. I also want to further develop the soft skills to connect and network with consulting partners and form meaningful business relationships with clients. I believe the unique experiences and community SCOPE offers would be an invaluable opportunity.

interest_reason: Consulting combines my interests in business and engineering. I’m also drawn in by the multi-disciplinary aspect of SCOPE consulting. It allows for collaboration across many different majors and, in my opinion, results in more cohesive solutions, ones that I might not have thought of by myself or with a team of only other mechanical engineers. The most exciting part of consulting for me is the evaluation of the various strategies a company can pursue and providing well-thought-out recommendations for those companies. It’s interesting to research and substantiate the solutions that can solve a problem. Before I make decisions in my own life, I consider my options and the likely outcomes; I see consulting as a reflection of my own personality. I also like how consulting allows one to work with different companies on a variety of problems, giving consultants the opportunity to keep their jobs fresh.
skills_expertise: My ability to collaborate while still being a leader is the best trait I can bring to SCOPE consulting. It allows me to work with others, gather our collective insights, and, ultimately, bring the best ideas together into a cohesive plan. I find this to be extremely important in any team setting but especially in consulting. Also, I have experience in consulting scenarios. In high school, I participated in DECA, a business roleplay club, and placed first in the state of Illinois in my sector. In this club, I would be presented with a financial or marketing problem a theoretical company was having and would recommend a solution in a ten-minute presentation to a judge. The experience I have from DECA directly correlates to what SCOPE consulting does.
expected_gains: From my time in SCOPE consulting, I hope to help solve real-world problems for clients, hone my problem-solving, collaborative, and communication skills, and also gain experience I can utilize in a career I would pursue after college. Additionally, I want to make connections within Purdue and also in the professional world.

- A Cause for Paws (weekly volunteering at Natalie’s Second Chance, 2 hrs/ week)
- Plan to work as an athletic academic tutor (a few hrs/ week)
interest_reason: I am interested in joining Scope primarily because of the club’s tangible impact on our community. The idea of working with real clients and bringing real world value is very appealing and would allow me to move past the theoretical work that comes with engineering design projects in my classes. Furthermore, joining Scope is a great networking opportunity. In my engineering specialty (biomedical), it seems that not many people are interested in consulting or even consider it as a career prospect. With consulting being my desired career, I am excited by the opportunity to be around likeminded people with whom I could share experiences.
skills_expertise: I will bring an unwavering work ethic and proven time management and project management skills. There is an extremely heavy workload associated with a Biomedical Engineering degree, and I have successfully maintained a 3.98 GPA while balancing this with a variety of extracurriculars over the past three semesters at Purdue. I bring unique skills that come with being a biomedical engineer. I have the ability to use intricate knowledge to make an informed decision while prioritizing the patients (clients) and their best interests above all. It is key to keep a level head and use solid analysis skills with minimal error. My business economics minor provides me with a different set of skills including being able to evaluate a population and predict consumer behavior. Thinking both technically and strategically in this way, I can analyze and distill technical information with an eye to economic factors. I also have strong written and oral communication skills allowing me to convey my thought process clearly to team members and clients.
expected_gains: I hope to sharpen my presenting skills and get used to speaking with clients in a professional setting, both things I will use far into my career. Additionally, Scope is full of connections and experience that could aid me in obtaining an internship and/or job in the future. The real-world consulting experience is very unique and is something that could set me apart from my peers when searching for a job. Finally, Scope brings an enclave of diversity of culture, thought, and past experiences in a school that can be quite demographically one-note. Coming from a large, demographically diverse urban environment, I miss the chance to interact with diverse perspectives that challenge my own ideals. Being a part of this club could not only help shape my career but also how I think.

Furthermore, as I am a great team player, I am able to fit in everyone's ideas cohesively during the brainstorm process as I have done it during team meetings.
expected_gains: My biggest strength is communication as I enjoy talking to others and learning about different perspectives. Therefore, I am excited to exercise this skill and apply it to projects where I know it will be useful. I hope to excel in my critical thinking skills specifically, as I believe challenging myself by working with companies would push me to think carefully.

interest_reason: As a student who aspires to become a technology consultant, I believe that SCOPE consulting can provide a solid foundation for my development in this field. The variety of projects that SCOPE has been a part of illustrates that the club strives for diversity in experience and develops consultants with a wide variety of skills. By being a part of impactful projects, I will have the opportunity to apply my learning outside of the classroom and provide valuable insight that can satisfy the needs of the client. Furthermore, the leadership of this organization is another factor that gained my interest. As a freshman with less experience than the accomplished upperclassmen and board members, the valuable knowledge I will gain from them will be a crucial step toward my career aspiration.
skills_expertise: I will bring a client-first mindset, analytical problem-solving ability, and a detail-oriented mindset to SCOPE. A client-first mindset is understanding that the client should be in the spotlight and doing whatever it takes to meet his/her needs regardless of the assigned task and work. I believe my determination can allow me to put a client-first mindset into practice during projects. Continuing, I will provide SCOPE with analytical problem-solving ability to help break down complex situations and provide powerful questions that can give valuable information. By utilizing this skill, I will be able to form useful solutions for clients. The detail-oriented mindset formed from a background in programming can allow me to deliver flawless work organized to clients and to help the team function more effectively.
expected_gains: I hope to gain a variety of skill sets that can prepare me for the workforce. Interacting with real clients can provide me with experience in how to address them and find solutions that can work with both parties. I also hope to obtain a clearer understanding of consulting and find ways that I can help the team complete their project to the best of their ability.

interest_reason: I have always been interested in getting involved with consulting. Consultants provide expert advice and guidance to organizations to improve best practices and solve issues. Without consultants, organizations are unable to get a fresh set of eyes to derive solutions based on data. As an engineer, I believe consulting is one of the best ways I can use the skills I've learned in class for practical application in the business world. As a student already involved in the COOP program with a semester of industry experience already under my belt, I have seen firsthand the importance of problem-solving in industry. This further reinforced my interest in consulting. I chose to join SCOPE over other consulting organizations on campus because of their emphasis on personal and professional development. Through participation in case competitions and working in small, 3-6 person project teams, I see plenty of room to grow and learn from others while having a positive impact on the community. Additionally, the organization's ability to take a project from start to finish in one semester speaks to their efficiency and the hardworking nature of their members.
skills_expertise: I have extensive industry experience under my belt. I gained firsthand experience of the common issues operators and employees face in the industry by working on the factory line in manufacturing the summer before school. Last semester, I completed a full co-op rotation with Avient, a global material formulation company. As a site process engineer at one of their manufacturing facilities, I was tasked with addressing issues around the site, either by conversing with operators or management or by observing them myself. I was also responsible for independently developing solutions to these issues and presenting them in a large presentation at the end of my rotation. During my rotation, I took on five major projects that had over $60,000 in value. Although it was challenging to juggle five major projects at once, with the help of my mentors, I was able to develop data-backed solutions for all of them, which were slated to lead to massive risk reduction in employee plant practices. I believe my firsthand experience in industry and industrial project work will be invaluable to SCOPE. In addition, I have baseline consulting experience, as I worked an internship at a veteran-owned aerospace consulting firm called Patriot Industrial Partners. There, I forged connections with middle-market aerospace companies, a skill that I believe would be highly beneficial to SCOPE.
expected_gains: I hope to gain experience in the field of consulting, and further develop skill that will help me succeed in the business world.

additional_info: I am slated to graduated in December 2024 due to my participation in the coop program. However, all other co-op rotations will be in the summer time, and will not interfere with my ability to be in SCOPE. I did not see a file selection for a resume. If this was done on purpose I apologize and please disregard, but if you would like to learn a little bit more about me and what I can bring to SCOPE you can find my resume at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W2M0ZiOoxUV-zWjxTG-J3IOa2L3O6jXU/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116274361761238319668&rtpof=true&sd=true

interest_reason: I would first like to explain the reason consulting interests me. The biggest reason is that most jobs value depth of knowledge, or specialization, significantly more than breadth and hence, almost no jobs expose people to a variety of new topics and skills quite like consulting does due its fast-paced nature. The opportunity to be consistently intellectually stimulated is something I value in projects that I take up. Secondly, and more importantly, I want to join an organization that does not just take up interesting and engaging projects, but also provides me with an outlet to make a tangible impact on campus and community through collaborative teamwork. I think SCOPE Consulting is the perfect place for me since your organization values engagement and commitment more that anything. I strongly believe that these qualities are indispensable for an aspiring consultant. This is because, while an existing skillset is important, it cannot be fully utilized without genuine engagement with clients, as well as commitment to bettering oneself at solving industry problems through learning from peers and past mistakes.
skills_expertise: Firstly, it is my fair assumption that not many people applying to SCOPE are in their senior year like me. I believe that me being further along in my coursework, especially as a double major, provides me with the knowledge that possibly not many other lowerclassmen would possess. Being a senior also means that I have had more time to gain professional experience and develop a strong skillset. For example, I have interned for two summers and gained valuable interpersonal skills through working with clients and colleagues. One of my internships was at Tesla in Summer 2022 as a manufacturing engineer. I was instantly thrown into a challenging and fast-paced environment and had to adapt to a steep learning curve. Over my time there, I had the chance to collaborate with my team on solving various Cybertruck design challenges while simultaneously taking up independent projects to aid higher level decision making. One of my primary responsibilities at Tesla was line balancing over a thousand processes for the Cybertruck and I can definitely say that I have become extremely proficient at using powerful analytical tools such as Excel, R and Python due to using them extensively for meeting design constraints while balancing based on time and station count constraints. I also took initiative and carried out multiple time and comparison studies, the findings of which were even presented in executive level meetings to drive better decision making. While most of my work experience is in technical roles and industries, the skills I have gained are easily transferable to a variety of consulting problems. In addition to my work experience, I have also been a part of various clubs like TedXPurdueU wherein I have built strong interpersonal relationships with speakers and efficiently handled the logistics of large events. Lastly, and most importantly, I have taken part in various case competitions, one of which was the Deloitte National Undergraduate case competition. My team secured first place in the competition with other Purdue teams and went on to represent Purdue on a national level. My involvement in such case-competitions is what sparked an interest in exploring the depths of consulting and I hope to do so while applying my skills and expertise at SCOPE.
expected_gains: As an industrial engineering major, I have always been amazed by the variety of job roles I get to choose from in my career. While most other majors have a limited and restrictive list to choose from, industrial engineers can choose from technical roles, logistics roles, analyst roles, and even consulting roles. While I enjoy applying myself in a technical environment, I have always had an interest in the financial aspect of the technical decisions made in a project. This is one of my major reasons for pursuing a major in economics as well. I want to apply my technical and financial knowledge in a place where I can make a genuine impact. The opportunity to do so while working with talented and like-minded peers at is what I plan to gain from this experience at SCOPE. As a result-driven person, I am highly motivated by seeing my work having a real impact and experiencing that during my time at SCOPE will be a huge gain for me. Through this experience, I also want to gain a better understanding of how consulting works before I can dive into a career in consulting.

interest_reason: Back in high school, I was a three time state winner and 4 time national qualifier in DECA, a club where I worked to create innovative solutions to different problems within different scenarios. DECA gave me my first interest in entrepreneurship and innovation which I eventually took as a sign to go into engineering. However, my desire to pursue more abstract problems and develop innovative solutions to larger-scale problems never disappeared. This is the main reason why I want to join SCOPE. I want to be part of a team that solves business problems. I want to improve some of my technical and entrepreneurial skills. Most importantly, I want to be surrounded by similarly-minded individuals that I can work hard with and enjoy the rewards with.
skills_expertise: In high school, I actually went through the entire product development cycle in creating a project for the annual Entrepreneurship Innovation Plan competition. Not only did I place first place, but it taught me a lot of the skills and factors that go into making a successful product and even a successful business. In addition, as an Engineering major here at Purdue, I like to think of myself as an objective individual, who analyzes a situation for many different subproblems before jumping into action. These skills, and the ability to work productively and efficiently as part of a team are essential qualities that I believe would serve me well if I was able to be a part of SCOPE consulting in the future.
expected_gains: DECA was one of the most engaging and fun experiences of my entire life. I feel like the entire situation, from the problem assessment to the presentation of solution is a process that I would enjoy and learn a lot from. Whether it be through presentation skills, teamworking skills, or even technical data analysis experience, there are so many ways for me to improve myself while contributing to the club. Lastly, I want to meet other people with similar goals and mindsets. These are the types of people that I feel like I would be able to "click" with right away and the people that I will enjoy being around even beyond the organization.

interest_reason: As a student at Purdue coming from, I really wanted to have an impact on the community. From the projects that SCOPE consulting does, it seems like they help surrounding businesses in the Lafayette area. Impacting the community really started for me in high school. I was the treasurer for the Rotaract club. I helped the executive board in setting up volunteer events during the week. Some events included the SF Biofreeze half Marathon and babysitting for parents afterschool at elementary schools in our district. Here at Purdue, I am also a part of Phi Delta Theta fraternity where we support ALS. We have multiple families in the area that we help out throughout the week that are affected by ALS. This winter, I have gone every other week to their house to do household chores that are hard for the family to do on a daily basis. This semester, I cut the lawn, cleared leaves, and hung up Christmas lights. By being a part of SCOPE, I can continue my impact on the community and hopefully see it into reality.
skills_expertise: As a student member of SCOPE Consulting, I would bring a passion for problem-solving and a willingness to think outside the box to the consulting club. My ability to think critically and analytically, as well as my ability to work in a team, would be valuable assets to the club. I am also proficient in various data analysis and research methodologies, which would be beneficial in conducting market research and providing data-driven recommendations to clients. I am also able to communicate effectively with clients, team members, and other stakeholders. I am the scholarship/ Academic chair of my fraternity so I work closely with our executive team to make sure everyone in the chapter(120 members) have the adequate grades to stay at Purdue
expected_gains: By joining SCOPE Consulting, I hope to grow as a person, not only intellectually but personally. I want to get to know others not only on a professional level, but a personal level as well. I feel that in order to work together as a team on a project, you must know each other better than just the “basic facts”. To succeed as a group, you should know more than where the other person is from or what they like to do for fun. It is truly more than that. I hope that this experience at SCOPE Consulting will allow me to have connections and experiences that I will treasure for the rest of my life.

additional_info: I feel that a trait that is overlooked is good listening. I feel that I embody the trait of being a good listener. Being a good listener is an important skill when working on a group project, as it allows team members to fully express their ideas and concerns. A good listener actively listens to what others have to say, rather than simply waiting for their turn to speak. This helps to create a more collaborative and inclusive environment, where all team members feel heard and valued.

I would want to apply the concepts I learn in class to real world projects and applications which would enhance my understanding of how to look at problems in a logical manner. Consulting involves giving professional advice for a wide range of subjects and I would definitely like to gain a deeper understanding regarding that field. Moreover, consulting also involves collecting data and essentially gathering more information which is something I have always liked to do. With the interesting projects that SCOPE Consulting undertakes and the diverse majors that members have, I think I would be able to learn a lot from this club.
skills_expertise: As an Economics major who is also considering a double major with Math, I have always liked looking from the logical side of things and would consider myself to be decent with numbers and data with a knowledge of STATA and Python.

interest_reason: By becoming a part of SCOPE Consulting, I can further its goals by bringing my cards to the table, and become one with the team.

On another note, I bring to the table my heritage as a Filipino and know that this allows me to offer a unique perspective on issues.

This will be an excellent opportunity for me to see problems local businesses are facing and learn to resolve those obstacles by working with peers and advisors. Having real life experience will be crucial to my professional development and connections, and it is exactly what SCOPE provides. I am interested in SCOPE because your training and career opportunities offered to members are exclusive and valuable. My current classes range from sophomore to senior level so it is hard to find peers to work together frequently on a constant basis. Therefore, I also want to join SCOPE to build my network inside the IE department with peers with similar interests.
skills_expertise: Communication skills: I believe talking to people, or clients, is one of my biggest advantages. Usually in professional or semi-professional circumstances, I am able to achieve my goals by putting myself in the shoes of other people and persuade them to reach a mutually satisfactory results.

This experience helped me to obtain a natural process of thinking when I am dealing with problems. Moreover, I used to run a small business myself for fun.

I want to develop my social and professional network in IE department and potentially networking with business partners.

interest_reason: Scope Consulting is the perfect place to grow and develop my professional skills. I wish to better my personal and professional communication skills. I want to work in a technological field in the form of consulting to gain experience for my future, as it is a field that I am looking into. I also strongly believe in Scopes's motto about building the leaders of tomorrow because cultivating our communication and leadership skills at an earlier stage can help us by giving us a foundation and preparing us for the future. The project teams are small, 3-6, so I can communicate easily with the client and get a more hands-on and interactive experience. I also wish to be better experienced in real-world opportunities and better myself as a person.
skills_expertise: I will bring a diverse set of eyes to Scope. Having lived in multiple places, my experiences have taught me much more than my education. Having worked in a professional setting during my summer at Google, I understood the importance of delivery and professional jargon. I learned to communicate with senior leaders in the company and adapt my vocabulary depending on who spoke to me. I also had worked in summer camp before, where I learned the importance of customer service by talking to the parents of the children. I also think on my feet, and these are skills Scope needs as a club.
expected_gains: I plan to improve my customer service skills through this club. I want to be more comfortable and confident in interviews and professional settings. I also want to develop connections and find my sense of community at Purdue. Scope. In the club callout, I learned about such positive experiences the existing club members had, which I also hope to experience. I also wish to grow and become a better version of myself.

interest_reason: In the middle of last semester, I made the tough decision that I was no longer pursuing medical school because a business career continued to cross my mind. I spoke with many different people in a variety of business jobs (accounting, human resources, finance, marketing, sales, and consulting) and felt like I found where I belonged after speaking to a couple of consultants. I love the fast-paced environment and client contact that consultants get to experience. As well as the teamwork required to complete projects. From here, I researched the consulting clubs available at Purdue and found SCOPE Consulting. SCOPE Consulting’s contact with real clients and opportunities to work on solutions and deliverables is why I am interested in joining. I appreciate that many of the clients are local to the Purdue area, allowing the club to have a positive impact on our Purdue community.
skills_expertise: My unique major will allow me to bring a different perspective to SCOPE Consulting. Biomedical Health Sciences is a mixture of public health and hard sciences, giving me critical thinking practice in a wide array of academic studies. Further, my background in toxicology research has given me practice with problem-solving, working with excel, creating slide decks, and presenting results to people from many different backgrounds. I also have had experiences in many different backgrounds of business. I have had a marketing internship, an accounting internship, led an entrepreneurship club at Purdue, and had a large involvement with Business Professional of America in high school. All these different exposures to business have led to a unique viewpoint when it comes to thinking through problems. Finally, my ability to work with a team and within a team would make me a good member of SCOPE Consulting. I am comfortable leading groups, but also know when to let someone else take the lead.
expected_gains: From this experience, I hope to gain knowledge about how a consultant works through a project from start to finish. More specifically, I want to experience the back and forth with a client to create solutions that work for their business model and create and present deliverables. Further, from this experience, I want to meet other hard-working Purdue students who are interested in a consulting career and learn as much from them as I possibly can.

interest_reason: I am interested in joining SCOPE Consulting because its ideals of accountability, diversity, and passion align with my own personal views and work ethic. While I am a Computer Science major, I've always been curious about how I could combine technology with business. Given that consulting is the nexus between data analytics, engineering, and business, I believe SCOPE can provide me with the tools to pursue my interests in these three areas. Joining SCOPE means gaining real-world experience that I could not get in the classroom. With a supportive and dedicated team, I will be able to tackle problems head-on and overcome any challenges that may arise. Furthermore, I value SCOPE's commitment to diversity. Consulting presents a wide range of issues, and having a variety of perspectives from people with different majors and backgrounds can encourage the team to create creative solutions and raise social awareness.
skills_expertise: The SCOPE consulting process begins with defining a timeline for goals, developing possible solutions, implementing final deliverables, and lastly closing the project. While the client only sees the final output, the journey to get there requires critical thinking, communication, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities. I believe I have all these skills that I can bring to SCOPE, as well as offer a fresh perspective on how to approach problems presented to us. Through my extracurricular activities in high school, I’ve conducted numerous interviews and webinars with various STEM professionals, allowing me to hone soft skills such as time management and networking. If something went wrong during these events, I would have to adapt and come up with thoughtful questions to ask the interviewees on the spot. Furthermore, my role as a tutor at Kumon taught me how to build relationships with students, parents, and supervisors. I understand how to work well within a group and talk with confidence when speaking to others. Aside from these qualities, I have some coding experience with Java and Python, which will allow me to quickly grasp the syntax of other languages if necessary. Additionally, I believe my enthusiasm and passion for SCOPE Consulting can compensate for any lack of experience. I am prepared to meet the challenges and overcome them with teamwork and dedication.
expected_gains: I hope to gain a new perspective on how to handle difficult business problems and unlock a side of technology that I wouldn't have discovered otherwise in the classroom. Consulting is a continuous learning process because it involves problems from fields I would not normally interact with, such as agriculture, medicine, or aviation. Developing solutions for these clients requires research that broadens my knowledge and teaches me new skills that I can apply in different scenarios or environments. Additionally, SCOPE's commitment to diversity will enable me to create a network of people from all over the world, allowing me to grasp the cultural differences that exist in business. The combination of work diversity and teamwork will accelerate my professional and personal development through the technical and soft skills I will master during my time as a consultant.
